You know I could switch gears and I could understand what's what people are talking about. So that's what I did recently.
Cool. Thank you. There's so much around story, including plots like the warp locks because a couple thoughts of our being about like they're only this many plots in the world and every story is derivative from these plots, but that number varies wildly, depending on who's reading the block Coast.
Let's go. Pete, Avril and Lauren
Everybody. I'm in San Diego, California our fires forties old or something in 25 Miles east of me. We just get high smoke on orange sun today Looks like it might be a way.
It's actually coming along there. They're starting to contain it. Um, so that's good, and there's been some evacuations and buildings destroyed, but not too many.
I also read on the news today that Lanie is coming this winter. So that means we are our rain season will be shorter Reign is in Southern California. The rain is only in the winter physically.
I've had a great week with talking with different folks from, you know, all of all of us and all our friends. Um, I'm excited, Teo. I've got kind of a question for the group. And I wonder if we might have time for this call. So five or 10 minutes, but I want to come back to it later.
Um, that's it.
Expiate several Lauren rumor.
Hi, everybody. I'm April I'm in Vancouver, British Columbia.
