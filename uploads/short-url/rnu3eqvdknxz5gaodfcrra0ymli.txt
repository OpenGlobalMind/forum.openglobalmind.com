07:45:07	 From scottmoehring : QUESTION:  Have our planning time horizons gotten shorter and shorter in the past 20 years? Personally, corporately, politically. As change accelerates, planning further out becomes more difficult, but also feels risky. You could be not only a little wrong, but completely wrong.
07:45:45	 From scottmoehring : How can we help others think past the next quarter?
07:45:46	 From Jerry on Multnomah lands : SIGGRAPH!

07:53:43	 From Jerry on Multnomah lands : projects pour through
07:54:18	 From Kevin Jones, second white family on Eastern Band Cherokee land : purchasing coops are one of the easiest way to cross domains; coordination is minimal, cuts costs of operation today
07:56:07	 From Kevin Jones, second white family on Eastern Band Cherokee land : sense making tools for people who make sense in non linear ways listening to stories and people who like grids and bullet points
07:57:21	 From Ken Homer–Miwok/Ohlone lands : This is an excellent summary of a book on how biology works
07:59:40	 From scottmoehring : Does this describe a thought process of future OGMer? “I feel hopeless > I see an alternative > I feel hope > I want to participate > I know how to participate > I see progress > I want to share with others.”
07:59:41	 From Hank Nelson : I can share it

08:02:22	 From Matt Saiia : hierarchy of consciences
08:02:25	 From Anthony : Regarding interdisciplinary integration:  Entities (like Food, Economics et) to not tie together.     A heriarchy of Activities (that use the entities as inputs) does.
08:03:07	 From charles blass : neil - ‘mutually assisted community’... method for governance of unlike
08:03:09	 From charles blass : minds
08:03:12	 From Matt Saiia : governance of unlike minds
08:03:40	 From Ken Homer–Miwok/Ohlone lands : What is we have “unlike minds” but “like hearts and like bodies?”
08:05:25	 From Julian Gomez : Digging this talk about interdisciplinary activity, but need to head over to SIGGRAPH. Will catch up with the recording.
08:05:42	 From Ken Homer–Miwok/Ohlone lands : +1 Neil - going back to Eric Hoffer’s quote from earlier - what are we educating our children for in this time of home/dome schooling as the world burns? Is STEM going to be sufficient to equipping our children to survive and thrive in the Pryocene?
08:05:48	 From Hank Nelson : Same gotta drop. Great convo. Will revisit
08:05:57	 From Judith Benham : Part of creativity is the need to co-mingle convergent & divergent thinking. William Miller on creativity,  Aspects/types of creativity.

08:07:49	 From Jerry on Multnomah lands : future histories
08:08:14	 From Jerry on Multnomah lands : Ackoff had a process called Idealized Redesign
08:08:15	 From Ken Homer–Miwok/Ohlone lands : What if what is needed is a timeline of aiming for the flourishing of all life for millions of years to come?
08:09:04	 From Anthony : Idealized vision of the future.    Negotiate the As-Is.  The To-Be naturally falls out.
08:09:05	 From Ken Homer–Miwok/Ohlone lands : I am a bit contrarian on the whole backcasting model - for example how many people in 2015 saw themselves trying to survive a pandemic?
08:09:36	 From Jerry on Multnomah lands : Builders
08:10:16	 From Jerry on Multnomah lands : as people show up, they find their way to where they can add their energy
08:10:44	 From Judith Benham : We need the ability to contemplate the and actuate the non-linearity of multiple future states. Can’t  include the unanticipated.changes.
08:10:50	 From Jerry on Multnomah lands : Matt then Charles
08:11:10	 From scottmoehring : Vision of Food Production combined with People & Habitats (I can’t recall Doug’s statement on this, about food production images not including people).
08:11:41	 From Jerry on Multnomah lands : Matt: make sure our conversations don’t get lost
08:12:21	 From scottmoehring : I worry that the public is focused on things that don’t matter if the substructure of food and shelter falls apart.
08:12:48	 From Jay Golden : In my research on future stories, so much of the story is about technological development. But I’ve found one big thing largely missing: Relationships. We look around and see all of the chasms between people, parties, race, human to nature…a lot of what I find is missing is the evolution of relationships.
08:13:11	 From Anthony : REf Matt:   We need a logical, natural way to partition the efforts.
08:13:31	 From Judith Benham : +5 Jay
08:13:59	 From Ken Homer–Miwok/Ohlone lands : @Jay - agreed!
08:14:44	 From Neil Davidson : Mass/ velocity/ inertia... you also need direction... YEP... and entrepreneurial projects cast a pebble in front that becomes a strange attractor... that, potentially, attracts sufficient people to make the old model obsolete... (after Bucky)
08:16:37	 From Kevin Jones, second white family on Eastern Band Cherokee land : tend and befriend.
08:16:53	 From Jerry on Multnomah lands : Mark, Charles, Judy

08:19:51	 From Jerry on Multnomah lands : food system shock
08:20:04	 From scottmoehring : Coming from a master decision-delayer, waiting for a perfect vision before starting is a common place to hide. The vision at any future point in time will almost certainly be different from what was originally described. Sketch out a vision, roughly, pick the most important things right now, then start walking towards them.
08:20:32	 From Ken Homer–Miwok/Ohlone lands : Some interesting tips here for talking to those “other-minded” people AKA Those People!: https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/07/15/1004950/how-to-talk-to-conspiracy-theorists-and-still-be-kind/
08:22:49	 From Jay Golden : @mark can you share the link to narrative within the climate web?
08:23:27	 From Mark Trexler : @jay - you referring to the premortem spot?
08:23:38	 From Mark Trexler : or the 17 climate narratives
08:25:00	 From Anthony : A map of activities drives all other maps
08:25:49	 From Matt Saiia : CN is also and incubator

08:28:46	 From charles blass : +1 judy...  “actionization”
08:30:09	 From Kevin Jones, second white family on Eastern Band Cherokee land : slaves were also capital; they were a leveragable asset; you could borrow against them.
08:30:44	 From Jerry on Multnomah lands : Ziba/lockdown, slavery, change = domain
08:33:06	 From Matt Saiia : please send me that slide

08:34:12	 From Jerry on Multnomah lands : taking people by the hand
08:34:21	 From Jerry on Multnomah lands : simple goals
08:35:07	 From Matt Saiia : system health intervention
08:35:24	 From scottmoehring : We need to help people understand that simple answers do not address the complexity, but that doesn’t mean they can’t participate. They just need to pick (or be guided to) the right level and area.
08:35:32	 From Matt Saiia : guilds can work across any domains
08:35:44	 From scottmoehring : Too many want to have a simple answer.
08:35:50	 From Matt Saiia : projects all live within and between domains
08:37:05	 From Matt Saiia : the role of trusted guides - shamans
08:37:19	 From Kevin Jones, second white family on Eastern Band Cherokee land : in fifth century bc greece and in 12th century high gothic france the world made sense to the stone mason and to the philosophers and theolgians.
08:37:48	 From Jerry on Multnomah lands : Judy, Matt, Charles
08:37:48	 From Kevin Jones, second white family on Eastern Band Cherokee land : they were making cathedrals to create a space to be close to god and they were creating a common vision of being citizens.
08:38:00	 From Kevin Jones, second white family on Eastern Band Cherokee land : when ashoka was king in india it was the same.
08:38:08	 From Jerry on Multnomah lands : Klaus: Drucker says systems sub-optimize
08:38:13	 From charles blass : hand up - update on tom atlee new pattern language project relevant to the thread
08:38:21	 From Jerry on Multnomah lands : partly they get captured
08:40:41	 From Jerry on Multnomah lands : craft
08:40:50	 From charles blass : matt - re systems intervention
08:40:53	 From Neil Davidson : Poem to close? 
08:41:13	 From Kevin Jones, second white family on Eastern Band Cherokee land : jack park has done a lot with guilds
08:41:15	 From Jerry on Multnomah lands : Judy, Charles, poem :)
08:41:20	 From Ken Homer–Miwok/Ohlone lands : Guilds are skills that can be applied across domains
08:42:44	 From Kevin Jones, second white family on Eastern Band Cherokee land : instead of checkins we could put on a hat with one word in the brim.
08:43:05	 From Matt Saiia : facilitation is to make it easy for system to become harmonious
08:43:06	 From charles blass : gather action points that are possible inflections, in experiential learning model  - judy
08:43:13	 From Kevin Jones, second white family on Eastern Band Cherokee land : or three words
