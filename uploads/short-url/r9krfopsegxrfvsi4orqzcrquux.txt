[0:25:36] spk_1: Now I could switch gears and I could understand what's that with what people are talking about? So that's what I did recently.

[0:27:19] spk_0: Cool. Thank you. There's so much of our own story is including plots like the plots s a couple thoughts in my brain about like there are only this many plots in the world, and every story is derivative from these plots, but the number varies wildly, depending on who's reading the block post. Um, let's go. Pete, Gabriel and Lauren,

[0:27:39] spk_5: everybody. I'm in San Diego, California are fires of four days old or something in 25 miles east of me. Um, we just get high smoke in orange sun today. Looks like it might be white. Um, it's actually coming along. They're they're starting to contain it. Um, so that's good. And there's been some evacuations and buildings destroyed, but not too many. Um e also read on the news today that La Nina is coming this winter, so that means our our rain season will be shorter. Um, rain is in Southern California. The rain is only in the winter. Basically, um, I've had a great week with talking with different folks from, uh, you know, all of all of us and all the reference. Um, I'm excited, Thio. I've got kind of a question for the group, and I wonder if we might have time for this call. Eso um five or 10 minutes. Um but I'd want to come back to it later. Um and that's it for you.

[0:28:43] spk_0: EXP April Lauren Rumor.

[0:28:48] spk_8: Hi, everybody. I'm April. I'm in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.
