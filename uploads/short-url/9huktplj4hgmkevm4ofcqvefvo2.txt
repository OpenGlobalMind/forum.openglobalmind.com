Cool. Thank you. There's so much around story isn't including plots. Like the or plotzed is a couple thoughts in my brain about like they're only this many plots in the world and every story is derivative from these plots of the number varies wildly depending on who's writing the blog post of capito, Brielle and Lauren.

Everybody I'm in San Diego California are fire is 40 years old or something in 25 miles east of me. We just got high smoke in Orange sun today looks like it might be white. It's actually coming along in there if they're starting to contain it. So that's good. And there's been some evacuations in buildings destroyed but not too many alphabet on the news today that Melania is coming this winter. So that means you are our rain season will be shorter rain is in Southern California. The rain is only in the winter.

I got a great week with talking with different folks from you know, all of all of us and all of our friends. I'm excited. I've got kind of a question for the group and I wonder if we might have time for it this call so 5 or 10 minutes, but I'd want to come back to it later. And that's it for April Lauren rumor.

Everybody behavioral. I'm in Vancouver, British, Columbia, Canada.
