<h3>Context</h3>
<p>When there’s learning happening, it’s because there is someone who is new to a topic, or to something about the topic.</p>
<h3>Forces</h3>

<img src="https://forum.openglobalmind.com/uploads/default/original/1X/ede5989ac3408f17721df86ef73cf054e2d42845.png" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="xWx4cZFCbsCAqrQoqTnXPiew3m5" width="109" height="61"> <strong>Mutuality</strong> : our individuality does not isolate us from one another, but draws us together.</p>
<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>Newcomers can feel overwhelmed by the amount of things to learn. They often don’t know where to start. They may have a bunch of ideas that the old-timers have never considered – or they may think they have new ideas, which are actually a different take on an old idea; see Reduce, reuse, recycle. People who are new to the project can tell you what makes their participation difficult. Since you’re learning as you go as well, you can ask yourself the same question: what aspects of this encounter are difficult for me?</p>
<h3>Solution [Summary]</h3>
<p>Instead of thinking of newcomers as “them”, and trying to provide solutions, we focus on newcomers as “us” – which makes the search for solutions that much more urgent. We permit ourselves to ask naive questions. We entertain vague ideas.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When “new” people come along that’s a good reminder of the above.</p>
<p>In the Peeragogy project, we try to keep track of what we’re learning (<a href="https://github.com/Peeragogy/PeeragogicalActionReviews/wiki/Template" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/Peeragogy/PeeragogicalActionReviews/wiki/Template</a>), and, increasingly, try to do meta-analyses of progress to understand how we could learn better; though we need to get better at this! See <a href="https://forum.openglobalmind.com/t/moby-dick-without-whales/524" class="inline-onebox">Moby Dick (without whales)</a>.</p>
<p>I mention these “peeragogy things” but they aren’t exclusive to the Peeragogy project!  I simultaneously think that OGM is very much a site of “peer learning and peer production”.</p>

<p>I noticed that on the front page of this Forum there is a count of posts per category.  Current throughput is summarised above. <img src="https://forum.openglobalmind.com/images/emoji/apple/point_up.png?v=9" title=":point_up:" class="emoji" alt=":point_up:"></p>
<p>I’m going to go ahead and assume that — in some sense — this reflects people’s actual priorities, at least in lieu of any stronger signals.  For example, people are very excited about “Designing the system”, but much less excited about “Bringing OGM to the world”.  The risk, of course, is that we fall into (*or over) the Waterfall methodology, rather than anything approaching an Agile mindset.  See figure:</p>

<p>Naturally, the quoted numbers might be biased; and there are bound to be some second-order effects (e.g., I take it as given that people post much more on the mailing list than on the forum, despite the request from <a class="mention" href="/u/peterkaminski">@peterkaminski</a> that they stop doing that). Focusing on those effects <em>might</em> amount to <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bikeshedding" rel="nofollow noopener">bikeshedding</a>. Nevertheless this is not to say that we should ignore all second-order thinking!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mead’s paper concluded with a proposal directed at the ASC itself, that it organise itself in the light of the ideas with which it was concerned. That is, the practice of Cybernetics by the ASC should be subject to Cybernetic critique, an idea returned to specially by Ranulph Glanville in his time as president of the society. — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-order_cybernetics" rel="nofollow noopener">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-order_cybernetics</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>I’m sure people are interested in bringing OGM to the world, in fact!</strong>  So, what are the obstacles to talking about this? To quote, rather than, paraphrase:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The real question, therefore, is to examine what are the constraints that exist inhibiting the expression of their group effort and self-help qualities designed to improve food and nutrition levels, clothing, shelter, health, sanitation, education and cultural life? The next question is how the rural communities can be helped to remove these constraints? What are the ways and means by which appropriate sciences and technologies can be integrated into the life of rural communities without disturbing their yet surviving cohesive qualities and without exposing them to further enslavement by such advanced knowledge and techniques? —  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120503153727/http://www.sarvodaya.org/about/philosophy/collected-works-vol-1/rural-self-help" rel="nofollow noopener">A.T. Ariyaratne</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>One way to proceed could be via the <a href="https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_leYr4yI=/" rel="nofollow noopener">Giant Wholeness Egg</a>, but it seems to me that this would require commitment and buy-in from at least a few people.  Would this be suitable for a “quest”?</p>

          <title>Collective Sense Commons Agora (A Chat Service)</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[peterkaminski]]></dc:creator>
          <category>OGM Connections</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>You may have heard me talking about the <strong>Collective Sense Commons</strong> (CSC) in the past month or so.  Or perhaps not.</p>
<p>Collective Sense Commons is an expression of my belief that there should be an information and communications commons for persons and organizations who are working on collective sensemaking.</p>
<p>It starts now with a chat service, running Mattermost software.  Mattermost is very similar to Slack.  Chat services like Mattermost or Slack are good for in-the-moment conversations, and for conversations that run from minutes to hours to days.  They are a little more quick and nimble than a forum (such as OGM Forum), which is why you might use a chat service instead of a forum.</p>
<p>On the flip side, chat services are harder to use for conversations that run from days to weeks to months, which is why you might use a forum instead of chat.  Or, maybe you just prefer one over the other, or hanging out with the folks who happen to use one or the other.</p>
<p>CSC is currently an ad hoc organization, similar to the way OGM is an ad hoc organization, although it’s much smaller right now, just me and a few advisors.</p>
<p>My general idea is that CSC is a member of OGM, and that OGM will hopefully be a member of CSC, together with many other individuals and organizations, in a big federation.</p>
<p>That’s a little ways down the road.  For today, I’d like to announce that CSC Agora is ready for Early Adopters or the very curious.  It is a nice, fresh install of Mattermost, currently with just two starter channels, “Town Square” (like <span class="hashtag">#general</span>, for Slack folks) and “Off-Topic” (like <span class="hashtag">#random</span>).  I expect soon we’ll have a couple of OGM channels, a couple of CICOLAB channels, and who knows, maybe a few others, based around other orgs, or other areas of interest, we’ll see.</p>
<p>In the coming weeks, I’ll also be setting up a CSC wiki, running MediaWiki.  But that’s for later; for now, if you’re a little adventurous, feel free to come check out CSC Agora!</p>

<p>Also consider installing dedicated mobile and desktop Mattermost clients, which you can use with CSC Agora and other Mattermost servers: <a href="https://mattermost.com/download/#mattermostApps">https://mattermost.com/download/#mattermostApps</a></p>

          <title>Opening Up Tuesday Calls</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[bhnelson]]></dc:creator>
          <category>OGM Calls</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>As Matt mentioned in last Thursday’s Open Call, we are broadening the audience of our regular Tuesday check-in calls. Until now Matt, Jerry, and I have been using this time to have more tactical discussions about how to mobilize around the OGM vision. It is time to include other voices in that as well.</p>
<p><strong>As of now, the meetings will follow our normal weekly cadence on Tuesdays at 10:00 AM EST/16:00 CEST.</strong>  We can discuss further tomorrow morning. I expect our initial discussions to be focused on the large themes that emerged during the OGM Design call, as well as how to continue harvesting the materials that we’ve received thus far.</p>

          <title>Collective Intelligence &amp; Wisdom: an OGM-branded virtual fair</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Technoshaman]]></dc:creator>
          <category>OGM Connections</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>In his email, <a class="mention" href="/u/jerry">@Jerry</a> called our attention to the EU Collective Intelligence Summit of next week. He also mentioned, “we often use this list to share things going on of interest.” That triggered the following stream of consciousness.</p>
<p>Yeah, the “collective intelligence summit” theme is certainly both OGMy and Technoshamany <img src="https://forum.openglobalmind.com/uploads/default/original/1X/a673a54eddce0a26b12e501c03e0775a492ef8e1.png" alt="🙂" data-base62-sha1="nKv1R58Zpr1ba9c06pFC4wixma5" width="48" height="48"> . Unfortunately, this one, just like most other events about the same subject, speaks <em>about</em> and not <em>from</em> it. I.e. The event designers don’t use the great brain power present in the conference hall, physical or virtual, for turning its collection of intelligence into a collective intelligence, beyond the eventual break-out rooms that, typically, lead to nowhere.</p>
<p>Well, maybe that’s not “unfortunate” because it gives <em>us</em> the opportunity for a truly trailblazing global event where CI wouldn’t only be the topic but CI principles and practices would be fully embedded in how it is designed, facilitated, and harvested.</p>
<p>Why not celebrate the global premiere of OGM with a masterfully designed unconference or virtual fair, where if someone wants to be a presenter, s/he would need to accept an answer from us, like, “only if you’re willing to participate in the practices for augmenting the CI of the whole event.”</p>
<p>For those of us curious about the history of the efforts to co-create CI-boosting public events, there’s a <a href="https://www.co-intelligence.org/CIC-Origins.doc" rel="nofollow noopener">“Collective Intelligence Convergence” write-up</a> about what I started with my friend, Tom Atlee, back in 1993. Those efforts culminated, in 2007, in the design of the <a href="https://www.co-intelligence.org/CIC-Invitation1.html" rel="nofollow noopener">Collective Intelligence and Human Choice</a> that was going to be a CI convergence event.</p>
<p>That plan didn’t materialize but both of the documents referenced above have plenty of mineable insights for future organizers of CI-augmenting events. The only tangible outcome from those efforts was that many of the invitees morphed into co-authors of the 648-page COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE: Creating Prosperous World at Peace anthology, to which I contributed a couple of chapters. (You can get the book on Kindle for $3.69.)</p>
<p>But not all of my big unconference organizing efforts remained fruitless. With my friends I co-designed and facilitated, in 1998, the Knowledge Ecology Fair, a highly successful, month-long virtual event attended by 400 participants from all over the world and complete with all this:<br>

<p>So, if my team could accomplish that, with some corporate sponsorship, 32 years ago, why couldn’t <em>we</em>, OGMers, not celebrate collective intelligence &amp; wisdom with a global virtual fair, complete self-organizing workshops, virtual booths of CI tool and process startups, knowledge café, etc.? Just an idea worth pondering…</p>

          <category>Connecting OGM with the World</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>We’ve discussed the issue of duplication of efforts due to a lack of clear, updated &amp; actionable information on what is out there and even more importantly, how to get involved. This has resulted in a highly fragmented landscape where many organizations and startups are not as effective as they could be and are competing for very limited resources to support their missions and create the change that we desperately need in a time of intersecting crises.</p>
<p>At the OGM Workshop we discussed breaking out into smaller teams. One particular team which I think is inevitable to form is a working groups towards a more connected OGM. This includes a potential directory, project matching, project list, and other ways to use discourse to connect OGMers to each other. I know a few of these already may exist in Jerry’s brain and other places, so I think we should take a look at these and focus on determining the pros/cons of each and making an intentionally designed “superset” project form/list in which projects can be imported from different sources. Interoperability is key.</p>
<p>I’ve started to make a <a href="https://airtable.com/shrsGSocir0dMYbVT" rel="nofollow noopener">project form</a> for a project I’m working on called Catalist (originally intended and used at innovation summits to connect conference attendees) which I’m happy to share and build off of to do this work within OGM. I think it’s quite comprehensive so it may need to be trimmed a bit. I’ve made it using airtable in a way that the information can be easily filterable (easily sort and group by location, topic, project type, and persona (designer/engineer, etc). This has the potential to passively match people who create a profile in which certain criteria for a project and the profile “match”. More details in the <a href="https://airtable.com/shrsGSocir0dMYbVT" rel="nofollow noopener">form description</a>.</p>
<p>I’d like to propose a time on the calendar, November 12th at 9:00am EST for anyone interested to join and discuss in detail. Regardless if we cover ground in this weeks Open meeting that I plan on joining, I will be available in the following <a href="https://meet.google.com/chy-rcxn-egh" rel="nofollow noopener">Google Room</a> an hour before next weeks OGM Open Call here: <a href="https://meet.google.com/chy-rcxn-egh" rel="nofollow noopener">https://meet.google.com/chy-rcxn-egh</a></p>
<p>Does anyone know of any existing “project lists”? Feel free to post here and we can collect them in a thread. I won’t even mention making a list of lists but it may be necessary…</p>
<p>Best,<br>
Vincent</p>

            <p>I looked around for a Storythreading thread, but found none. There is an event tomorrow that may be of interest, so starting a thread at least to share resources for the time being.</p>
<p><strong>The Online Learning Series, hosted by the IFVP continues on August 18 with Anthony Weeks, from San Francisco, USA!</strong></p>
<p>During this episode  <strong><a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001DKRnrSfrmeB9yqdI9EvHUFfNMDuMvd3DhFXGGdG1svcTPyqm-AU6W6rc_LPQtMwsJ13oJxA6N9MOCtb308ULT9XqVaj7Xv0_XQYGIe9tgDQmI1MRy0byS8GsGwDlLZ96AmzgqoRUNkZL7DGOfPS4z2moV-Vh_fttbvfWeuld369raA1BMCOUVQeF3RgRVkee8N7q79rAfVQ=&amp;c=7QchjOqPXjUDrR_2LB-aFORjJ3xc_TBTFlHuHeJHgc543mT1sOshXA==&amp;ch=Kp5LvEIuMyMc2rhau5zDXswRi9ofwnvWVyDSCVh6UDSMIjm8iI2V4g==" rel="nofollow noopener">Anthony Weeks</a></strong>  will  explore the role of the listener in visual practice.</p>
<p>Specifically, Anthony will invite us to talk and listen together about:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>How do we bring our whole selves to our listening practice while not making it all about us?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do we test our listening practices to see which of our own stories, past experiences, biases, and filters influence our abilities to listen to stories that are not our own?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What does “ethical listening” mean? Why does it matter?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do our positions in the room/online/in relation to participants/in our communities/in the world affect the ways in which we listen?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why is listening important in visual practice? It’s all about how things look, right? If that’s not true, why are we so impressed by it/worried about the aesthetics?</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s the blurb (also on the page above):</p>
<p>====</p>
<p>“How can we improve our perception of the complexity we live within, so we may improve our interaction with the world?”</p>
<p>About this Event</p>
<p>We are delighted to host Nora Bateson and Phoebe Tickell this Thursday for a discussion focused on cooperative frameworks for advancing cooperation across disciplines in a post covid-19 world.</p>
<p>Nora Bateson is an award-winning filmmaker, writer and educator, as well as President of the International Bateson Institute, based in Sweden. Her work asks the question “How we can improve our perception of the complexity we live within, so we may improve our interaction with the world?”. Her work brings the fields of biology, cognition, art, anthropology, psychology, and information technology together into a study of the patterns in ecology of living systems.</p>
<p>The IBI integrates the sciences, arts and professional knowledge to create a qualitative inquiry of the integration of life. As President, Nora directs research projects at the IBI that require multiple contexts of research and interdependent processes. Asking, “How can we create a context in which to study the contexts?”, an impressive team of international thinkers, scientists and artists have been brought together by the IBI to generate an innovative form of inquiry, which Nora coined “Transcontextual Research”.</p>
<p>Phoebe Tickell is a scientist, educator and serial systems entrepreneur. She has co-founded a series of organisations that steward systems change via innovation, weaving together networks and learning programmes across the sectors of education, food and farming, sustainability, and technology. She has a first class degree in Biological Natural Sciences from Cambridge University, and she brings this training in understanding biological networks and systems thinking into all of her work.</p>
<p>She brings her training in systems and networks into the areas of sustainability, re-thinking business and work, and personal development. She is part of the design and delivery team of a cutting-edge Master’s programme at Schumacher College, UK, which trains and prepares students for a complex world with a basis in systems thinking, network science, complexity, and earth systems science, and the Youth Initiative Programme, Sweden. She is a Member of the social change freelancer network Enspiral which both supports and is supported by her work.</p>
