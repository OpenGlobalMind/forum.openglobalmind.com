            <p>Continuing the discussion from <a href="https://forum.openglobalmind.com/t/making-ogm-forum-publicly-visible/389/14">Making OGM Forum Publicly Visible</a>:</p>
<p>Thanks Pete!  Another use case for making the forum public is that it may be a better “landing page” for Open Global Mind than <a href="http://openglobalmind.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://openglobalmind.com/</a> is … at least, in my opinion!  That said, should we look into improving the main domain… soon?  I’d like to put an “affiliation” to Open Global Mind in my professional bio. Can I nominate myself to be part of a website Working Group?</p>

            <p>I feel odd about writing this because I’m new and unknown, but I hope it might give people some idea of how I might fit in. I’d be happy to answer questions posed about my experience, education, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Be warned:</strong> This may be more than you wanted, needed or hoped for. <img src="https://forum.openglobalmind.com/images/emoji/apple/stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:"></p>
<p><em><strong>Where on the globe are you?</strong></em> Yes.  Whoops, I mean, Milford, Ohio, USA.</p>
<p><em><strong>What is your main gig?</strong></em> I don’t have one. Having taught English for 10+ years in Indonesia (self-taught teacher), I’ve come to realize just how inadequate English is as an international language, and how vexing it is, too. I enjoy public speaking but I would love to be mentored to become better at it.</p>
<p><em>I’m a(n):</em></p>

          <title>OGM Forum Is Now Publicly Visible</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[peterkaminski]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Announcements</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hello OGM Folks!</p>
<p>As you probably already know, OGM does much of its work in public view.  Our regular meetings, for instance, are recorded and posted and made available for anyone to view on YouTube.</p>
<p>Similarly, Jerry and Pete always intended OGM Forum posts to be viewable to anybody (and any search engine) on the web, without any sign-in required.  It’s not that way right now, just for the simple reason that the right switch didn’t get flipped during setup.</p>
<p>We would like to flip that switch now, and make all the posts that regular forum members can see viewable by anybody on the web, without sign-in.   By making the Forum public, outsiders could view the Forum content, but they could not post unless they were invited or registered and approved to do so.</p>
<p>Any attachments to posts would also be visible.  The <a href="https://forum.openglobalmind.com/u">user information pages</a>, however, would <em>not</em> be visible.</p>
<p>Timeline-wise, we would make the change around the end of November 2020.</p>
<p>Does that all sound okay?  Please share your thoughts by replying to <a href="https://forum.openglobalmind.com/t/making-ogm-forum-publicly-visible/389">this topic</a>, or ping Jerry or Pete.</p>
<p>You can dismiss this announcement by clicking the “x” button in the upper right of this box.</p>
<p>Thanks for using OGM Forum!</p>
<p>– Jerry and Pete, your hosts on OGM Forum</p>

          <title>OGM Forum New User Guide</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[anderbill]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Start Here</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <div data-theme-toc="true"> </div>
Welcome! As a new user of OGM Forum, we hope you find this site usable and well structured. Here is some guidance to get you started:
<hr>
<h2>Basic Terms Used by OGM Forum (Nomenclature)</h2>
<p>Here are some basic terms that are helpful to keep in mind as you use OGM Forum or read this guide (note: the images in this topic are from the main Discourse site, so details might differ from what you see on OGM Forum):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Topic</strong>: The collection of messages grouped together in a conversation, with a title, listed in a category, beginning with an Original Post, and including all replies in chronological order.<br><br>
Elsewhere this might be called a ‘thread’ but OGM Forum uses ‘topic’ since <strong>thread</strong> is used for linked elements that can go off in many different directions (and be confused with software programming terms).</li>
<li>
<strong>Post</strong>: Each element of a topic is referred to as a <strong>post</strong>. Each post has its own author and can be moved to a different topic if desired, or even become the start of a new topic.</li>
<li>
<strong>Original Post (or OP)</strong>: The first post in any topic. This is key since it determines the focus of the topic and is what the title and tags will link to.</li>
<li>
<strong>Category</strong>: The primary means of organizing topics.  Each topic is placed in exactly one category.  Categories have permissions which can restrict which users can create, reply, and see its topics. You can also configure notification preferences per category or even mute them as explained below. Categories are a similar concept to a ‘forum’ on other sites.</li>
<li>
<strong>Tag</strong>: A marker placed on a topic to describe it. While a topic can only have one category, it can have multiple tags. New tags can be created by some users. You can read more about the <a href="https://meta.discourse.org/t/what-are-differences-between-tags-and-categories/29218/3?u=john_lehmann">differences between tags and categories</a>.</li>
<li>
<strong>User</strong>: OGM Forum (like all Discourse sites) may be private or public for anyone to read, but you need to register in order to create posts and record any actions such as bookmarking, liking, tagging, and flagging. Most site activity, therefore, is based around registered <strong>Users</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Browsing the Forum</h2>
<h3>Topic lists</h3>
<p>By default, the OGM Forum homepage shows all <strong>Latest</strong> conversations in the community you can filter this list in a number of ways:</p>
<p><img src="https://forum.openglobalmind.com/uploads/default/original/1X/7ad708e8013caa1c0624d30f0c44ade975d3a0bb.png" alt="discourse-views_690x108" data-base62-sha1="hwGXBgzuwK96Tcy36235yOj2vCH" width="690" height="108"></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>By category</strong>: in the menu line, click the ‘all categories’ title and a list of all the categories appears.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>By tag</strong>: in the menu line, click the ‘all tags’ title and a list of all the tags used appears.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>By level of activity</strong>: if you click on ‘Top’ the conversation topics will be listed in order of most activity (views and replies) for a specific time period. You can choose whether this is for all time, or select a specific period such as quarter, month, week, or just today.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>By what’s ‘New’ to you</strong>: by default, new topics are those created in the last 2 days that you have not opened yet. New topics show a small blue dot next to the topic title.<br>
<img src="https://forum.openglobalmind.com/uploads/default/original/1X/a0f06c2225147c3668c2fb213dca21caf0967063.png" alt="discourse-topic-new-indicator_345x69" data-base62-sha1="mXJuRQFi1cWn1cQspIkq7bG8hur" width="345" height="69"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>By what topics are “Unread”</strong>: by default, unread topics are those that you have previously opened and read for  <em>at least</em>  4 minutes, and to which new posts (replies) have been submitted. Unread topics show a number in a blue circle indicating how many new posts are in the topic.<br>
<img src="https://forum.openglobalmind.com/uploads/default/original/1X/66569fab17b8affa1cc178419ae154e98bab15a8.png" alt="discourse-topic-unread-indicator_345x67" data-base62-sha1="eBki833FVu4SFMkS3hgAsxAGW3S" width="345" height="67"></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>See who is participating</h3>
<p>There are several ways to see who is involved in topics.</p>
<p><img src="https://forum.openglobalmind.com/uploads/default/original/1X/335050c33bb5814843a76decbc060cb274544503.jpeg" alt="discourse-participants" data-base62-sha1="7jWqpYGqEsDKi0L3MJZOxFd4a4j" width="166" height="92"></p>
<p>On the homepage you will see a selection of avatars (profile pictures) of:</p>
<ul>
<li>the user who started the topic (always the first photo);</li>
<li>a selection of the most active participants;</li>
<li>and who created the most recent post (usually the last photo).</li>
<li>In some cases, the first photo has a blue border or blue halo to indicate that the original poster is also the most recent poster<br>
<img src="https://forum.openglobalmind.com/uploads/default/original/1X/29ba295e9ea618067228a361e120bc1f0b41561a.jpeg" alt="discourse-original-poster" data-base62-sha1="5X8qoiKtQq7pxYGw9PvknomKOvw" width="172" height="54">
</li>
</ul>
<p>The box at the bottom of the OP tells you: who created the post and when; gives a count of the replies and views in this topic to date; displays the avatars of the most frequent participants.</p>
<p><img src="https://forum.openglobalmind.com/uploads/default/original/1X/777e67b9c2fc838141ff2510df012034b85843c4.png" alt="discourse-topic-map_690x141" data-base62-sha1="h35DJlrUNex8kAQNkPB5ki2XNmA" width="690" height="141"></p>
<h2>Navigation Tools</h2>
<ul>
<li>For Search, the Menu, or your User page, use the <strong>icon buttons at the upper right</strong>.<br>

<p>A healthy community needs members to be posting new content, but this activity is not everything. Readers are the true indicators of how healthy the community is. What’s the point of posts that no one reads? Discourse encourages and tracks reading habits so community managers can keep a healthy balance.</p>
<h3>Keep scrolling</h3>
<p>Click a topic title and read down the list of replies in chronological order, following links or previewing replies and quotes as you go. Use your mouse to scroll the screen, or use the timeline scroll bar on the right which also shows you how far through the conversation you’ve read. On smaller screens, select the bottom progress bar to expand it.</p>
<h3>Jump back in</h3>
<ul>
<li>Selecting a topic title takes you to your <strong>last read post</strong> in the topic. To enter at the top ↑ or bottom ↓ instead, click the reply count or last reply date.<br>

</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Topics above the light red line on a list are new or updated since your last visit. If you have read all the way to the end of a topic, the title will be light grey instead of black.<br>

</li>
</ul>
<h3>Related topics</h3>
<p>Sometimes conversations are clearer if topics are split, where posts are moved to a more appropriate topic, or two related topics are merged. If a post is moved, a link appears that allows readers to jump to that comment wherever it has been moved to, and the person who posted it is also notified.</p>

<p>At the end of the OP you will also see lists of <strong>related topics</strong> that link to the one you are reading</p>
<p><img src="https://forum.openglobalmind.com/uploads/default/original/1X/d5df30bfadc65804cd35cafe2f9146055bb921f2.png" alt="related-topics_690x188" data-base62-sha1="uvZSPXDoqHIU2gQPLRRNmM3nkd4" width="690" height="188"></p>
<h2>Taking Part in Conversations</h2>
<h3>Replying</h3>
<p>Press any <img src="https://forum.openglobalmind.com/images/transparent.png" alt="composer" data-orig-src="upload://niPICV3Uuc0ujRPT8BiJ1w96kfC.png" width="25" height="23">  <strong>Reply</strong> button to open the editor panel at the bottom of your browser. You can continue reading (and even search or navigate to different topics) while you compose your reply.</p>
<p><img src="https://forum.openglobalmind.com/uploads/default/original/1X/ccc0848a3f62eb44ccfaaa824a61df94ce84421a.gif" alt="collapse-expand-editor_516x184" data-base62-sha1="tdjS1kSdv25oBTcZQbvFp2QU0We" width="515" height="184"></p>
<p>Discourse shows all posts in the order they are published. It does not make you chase down multiple threaded paths. However, it still gives you lots of ways to follow the context of conversations.</p>
<p>To reply to a <strong>specific post</strong> in a topic, click the grey <strong>Reply</strong> button at the end of each post and your reply is linked to that post.</p>
<ul>
<li>If your reply is the next one published after the post you are replying to, this appears next in chronological order</li>
<li>If yours is NOT next, then two things happen after your post is published:
<ul>
<li>Your post includes a new link in its header with an image to show what this is ‘in reply to’ - clicking this link displays that previous post for context next to your reply</li>
<li>The original post includes a count of replies at the bottom - clicking this link displays the content of the replies</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Drafts</h3>
<p>Drafts are saved as you write. If you minimize the editor or navigate to a different topic, the editor might disappear. To open a draft, return to the topic you were replying to or click the highlighted bar at the bottom of your browser, and the editor will reappear with your draft.</p>
<h3>Quoting</h3>
<p>To insert a quote, select the text you wish to quote, then press the Quote button that pops up. There is no need to quote the a whole message, it helps to be specific. Repeat this for multiple quotes even from different posts and different users. The quoted text will point to their original source.</p>
<p><img src="https://forum.openglobalmind.com/uploads/default/original/1X/a009ce77653889f269c3e39042095eabc4e00507.gif" alt="quoting" data-base62-sha1="mPLp9cSX9ViqOayUL0DQy4CPImX" width="545" height="107"></p>
<h3>Mentioning</h3>
<p>To notify someone about your reply, mention their name. Type <code>@</code> to begin selecting a username. This will also search the name fields in case you don’t know a particular username.</p>

<h3>Emoji</h3>
<p>To use <a href="https://emojipedia.org/">standard Emoji</a>, just type <code>:</code> to match by name, or traditional smileys <code>;)</code></p>
<p><img src="https://forum.openglobalmind.com/uploads/default/original/1X/b99f5b002a18b03943d60e7f1094340f744c309b.gif" alt="emoji-completion" data-base62-sha1="qu5Kti65qihBsJZZGfNlyuU6c7F" width="263" height="212"></p>

<h2>Notifications</h2>
<p>When someone is <strong>talking directly to you</strong> — by replying to you, quoting your post, mentioning your <code>@username</code> , or linking to your post, a blue number immediately appears over your profile picture at the top right.</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p><strong>Where on the globe are you?</strong></p>
<p>In Brighton, a beautiful seaside town 1-hr from London. Originally from Budapest, and spent 20 yrs in California. I came here because regarding the culture and nature in Europe, (next to Barcelona) Brighton comes the closest to Santa Cruz, my fave ol’ stomping ground.</p>
<p><strong>What is your main gig?</strong></p>
<p>presently, it’s <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k9t25tYRMrBiN5UdBJ8C7ER7AXUXboogBWVyVExU3ZA/edit" rel="nofollow noopener">SymmaSys</a>, a project of <a href="https://futurehow.site/" rel="nofollow noopener">Future HOW</a>, which will use my Generative Action Research methodology that I wrote about <a href="https://www.academia.edu/33749187/On_the_Verge_of_Collective_Awakening" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a> and will be conducted, hopefully, in collaboration with the Hashverse of CICOlab.</p>
<p><strong>LinkedIn link?</strong> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/georgepor/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.linkedin.com/in/georgepor/</a></p>
<p><strong>What is your connection to OGM?</strong></p>
<p>in one word: <strong>Jerry</strong></p>
<p>in a few more words, from my <strong>“global mind” researcher</strong> side: the “Designing for the Emergence of a Global-scale Collective Intelligence” paper that I <a href="http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/GB-issue/GB-oldstuff/Por3.html" rel="nofollow noopener">presented</a> at a conference in 2001</p>
<p>in a few more words, from  my <strong>“social acupuncturist”</strong> side: the possibility to use my gifts for helping to unblock whatever prevents the energy flow more freely in the social body of OGM</p>
<p>in a few more words, from  my <strong>“future chronicler”</strong> side: what I wrote about in <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hDe5NGcPsbTSxnvUCcRhNXlxFxs7OhSja3ztL6tPeMU/edit" rel="nofollow noopener">my OGM2025 story</a></p>
<p><strong>What part interests you most?</strong></p>
<p>definitely, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicate_and_explicate_order" rel="nofollow noopener">enfolded/implicate part</a>, in David Bohm’s sense</p>
<p><strong>What are your superpowers?</strong></p>
<p>being an evolutionary sherpa (see below)<br>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>(also cross-posted to the OGM mailing list)</p>
<p>As mentioned at the end of the workshop, OGM hosts our “OGM Forum,” a discussion service using the open source <a href="https://www.discourse.org/">Discourse</a> software.</p>
<p>Sign in here: <a href="https://forum.openglobalmind.com/">https://forum.openglobalmind.com/</a></p>
<p>Or if you don’t have an account yet: <a href="https://forum.openglobalmind.com/invites/33167533e3908379553bb28752a57dbc">https://forum.openglobalmind.com/invites/33167533e3908379553bb28752a57dbc</a></p>
<p>In the spirit of community and barn-raising, I will say that we need to put some more time and energy into making it a more welcoming, more effective place to host our shared conversations and artifacts.  It is currently not all that it can be, or all that we deserve.</p>
<p>For OGM Forum, I set up the software, and Jerry and I set up some initial categories.  But I’m just the system administrator.  And Jerry is certainly our muse and inspiration, but he is not the Chief Discusser.  We need more people to chip in and help make OGM Forum, itself, better.</p>
<p>We need:</p>
<ul>
<li>better onboarding for new people, and a better new user experience</li>
<li>short video demos of how to use Discourse in general, and OGM Forum in particular</li>
<li>more people thinking about improvements to the information architecture</li>
<li>more people doing network weaving: cross-pollinating, seeking to make connections between people and conversations both within OGM Forum</li>
<li>more discussion there!</li>
</ul>
<p>The good news <img src="https://forum.openglobalmind.com/images/emoji/apple/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> is that we don’t have some big company that we do all those things for us – we get to do it right, ourselves!</p>
<p>If you need it, I’d be happy to give you a 20-minute personalized introduction to OGM Forum via Zoom, just pick a time on my calendar: <a href="https://calendly.com/peterkaminski/ogm-forum-intro">https://calendly.com/peterkaminski/ogm-forum-intro</a></p>
<p>Or, if you want to volunteer to lead projects addressing the needs above, let’s talk!  Send me email or ping me at +1-650-918-6101 (sms, whatsapp, telegram).</p>
<p>I’ll also schedule an OGM Forum Betterment meeting next week sometime to introduce / brainstorm / act.</p>

            <p><strong>Where on the globe are you?</strong>  I am mainly in Arlington VA and spend a lot of time in Bluffton SC (near Savannah GA and Hilton Head SC)</p>
<p><strong>What is your main gig?</strong>  I own and run a Management, Strategy, and Design consultancy (Arc Aspicio) mostly focused on the US government, in particular Homeland Security. <a href="http://www.arcaspicio.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.arcaspicio.com</a></p>
<p><strong>LinkedIn link?</strong>  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/okeeferob/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.linkedin.com/in/okeeferob/</a></p>
<p><strong>What is your connection to OGM?</strong>  I am a long time user of The Brain, on and off over many years. As such I became interested in a variety of Jerry’s initiatives, such as Inside Jerry’s Brain (IJB) chats. Mostly a lurker.</p>
<p><strong>What part interests you most?</strong>  I am a connector. I would like to see this community evolve and then have connections to spiritual/self development communities and Bitcoin communities and art/photography communities. I have an interest in finding news sources that are close to the place the news is happening and are not part of a major media conglomerate.</p>
<p><strong>Extra credit: What are your superpowers?</strong> I am a connector and empathetic. I have poor memory, which is why i use The Brain! Ha!</p>
<p>I like finding new music and sources of music. I think the two party system is broken and damaging in the US. I think the USD based monetary system is broken and damaging to the world.</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="/u/robok">@RobOK</a> suggested that we might be able to make the <a href="https://forum.openglobalmind.com/">main page</a> more useful, and I’ve switched the way topics are displayed there to see more.  I’m still looking for the way to list more topics per category, which might help, too.</p>
<p>There’s an information and visual appearance tradeoff between the two looks.  I agree with Rob that more topics are probably better.  But comment here on what you think!</p>

            <p>I am passionate about making sense of the onslaught of information we receive and taking effective collective action.</p>
<p>A project that might be interesting to this group is building mass agreement with <a href="https://ReasonScore.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Reason Score</a> and <a href="https://GulliBot.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Gulli Bot</a></p>
<ul>
<li>You can see my current projects and all my social media links <a href="https://BentleyDavis.com" rel="nofollow noopener">BentleyDavis.com</a>
</li>
<li>I live in Dallas Texas USA</li>
<li>I like to prototype other people’s passions and build my own startups. I am a contract app/web developer (full stack)</li>
<li>My LinkedIn is <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/bntlyd" rel="nofollow noopener">bntlyd</a>
</li>
<li>My connection to OGM is I have been following Jerry on YouTube for many years and jumped when he introduced OGM.</li>
<li>What part interests you most? How can we have a shared assessment of reality we make collective decisions and actions. I also like build experimental tools.</li>
<li>My superpowers are seeing elegant patters and expressing them to others in a way they can (often) understand. I can also implement those patterns in code and user interfaces.</li>

            <p><strong>Where on the globe are you?</strong>  Living in Bend, Oregon</p>
<p><strong>What is your main gig?</strong> Volunteer for a group of NGOs focused on climate change, specifically as it relates to food and agriculture</p>
<p><strong>LinkedIn link?</strong>  I like to mess around on LI, it’s the best ever free focus group research <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/klaus-mager-47078512/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.linkedin.com/in/klaus-mager-47078512/</a></p>
<p><strong>What is your connection to OGM?</strong>  Several connections in the network</p>
<p><strong>What part interests you most?</strong>  I’m laser focused on anything related to soil. Soil is life, there is more life inside the soil than there is on top of it. Out of soil grow plants that feed other forms of life, give back to it in return. An entirely interdependent system which we are in the process of destroying for lack of understanding. Only we are part of it, committing suicide inadvertently.</p>
<p>Extra credit: What are your superpowers? I have this crazy background starting as a chef, which btw is an awesome skill to have at this time with my favorite restaurants all out of commission. I was working on $billion projects leading teams responsible for anything you could eat or drink, from ideation, design, operational startup, supply chain development, corporate alliances. Also international, my last gig was corporate as head of target group marketing with teams in 30 countries, based out of Germany. Totally in awe with Theory U as a social systems change management tool. It works!</p>

            <ul>
<li>
<strong>Where on the globe are you?</strong> Moving soon to Boston, MA</li>
<li>
<strong>What is your main gig?</strong> Solution Design Partner at Collective Next (<a href="https://collectivenext.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://collectivenext.com/</a>)</li>
<li>
<strong>LinkedIn link:</strong> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bradley-h-nelson/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.linkedin.com/in/bradley-h-nelson/</a> (it’s a little outdated)</li>

<strong>What is your connection to OGM? What part interests you most?</strong> I met Jerry back in March and the rest is history! I like that OGM provides a place for people who to think, learn, and grow. I just find it so thrilling that the conversations can go from philosophy to somatics to education within 5 minutes. I’m most interested in exploring my own passions and interests alongside others doing the same. Something good has to come out of that.</li>
<li>
<strong>What are your superpowers?</strong> Personally, I’m still figuring that out. I am a deep thinker, good listener, and do things very intentionally. I think that leads to a simple faith in success that I can tap into. I can get enthusiastic about almost anything (within moral boundaries, of course). f you have an idea you want to pursue and you really believe in it, I will do everything I can to make that happen. I try to always look at things from multiple perspectives and have little patience for willful ignorance. To speak tactically, I have a lot of experience designing user flows, developing business cases, coordinating global teams, and the business side of software delivery. As such, I have written my fair share of compelling feature narratives to illustrate the importance of moving a pop-up window <img src="https://forum.openglobalmind.com/images/emoji/apple/slightly_smiling_face.png?v=9" title=":slightly_smiling_face:" class="emoji" alt=":slightly_smiling_face:"> (though I’ve done some more exciting things too).</li>

            <p>Hello!  I am Peter Kaminski.  Informally, I call myself Pete.</p>
<p>I have a calling to help people of good intent work together to accomplish what they believe to be important. I value knowledge, wisdom, kindness, harmony, wholeness, and gratitude for all living beings. I believe that helping one helps us all, and hurting one hurts us all.</p>
<p>I hope my work on the projects here: helps others work together better; helps others help themselves to accomplish what they believe to be important; creates more knowledge and especially more connections between people; helps heal the world and its beings; furthers my work with personal and collective information spaces; helps me create more artifacts for teaching others about collaboration; and helps me grow my network of friends and colleagues.</p>
<p>Along with personal and collective information spaces, a couple more personal interests that may align: alternative economies; “the matchmaker problem” (as I call it: how might people who have and need things find each other); preparing the world to work together better locally and globally in a changing climate; and intentional communities, and how they sustain and grow and think and remember.</p>
<p>In my professional life, I am a startup entrepreneur and consultant to businesses and nonprofits/NGOs. I do both software product development/deployment, and coaching on collaboration process. I’ve worked on the Internet since 1992, and with computers since 1977.</p>
<p>In my personal life, I am married to the same wonderful woman for 35+ years.  We have two grown kids who were unschooled until university. I enjoy travel, the outdoors, genealogy/family history, photography, music production, and indoor rock climbing.</p>
<p>I’ve lived in the United States, in western Nevada, the San Francisco Bay Area, Southern California, and Washington DC. We currently reside in San Diego.</p>
<p>I have LinkedIn and Facebook profiles, feel free to find me, but I don’t interact much there.</p>

          <title>Introduction: skreutzer</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[skreutzer]]></dc:creator>

            <ol>
<li>
<p>Where on the globe are you?<br>
Germany</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is your main gig?<br>
I’m full-time employed at a dayjob (translates to a shortage when it comes to volunteering time/capacity for OGM, but also to no financial interest).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LinkedIn link?<br>
Not on LinkedIn.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is your connection to OGM?<br>
Tried for a long time to find + join groups or individuals who want to do practical, technical work of the kind mentioned in the OGM meetings, which never worked out for various interesting reasons, and now I hope this has a better chance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What part interests you most?<br>
Usually I’m doing basic work around text, publishing, hypertext, media and hypermedia as pioneered by <a href="https://www.invisiblerevolution.net/video.html" rel="nofollow noopener">Douglas Engelbart</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TheTedNelson/videos?view=0&amp;sort=da&amp;flow=grid" rel="nofollow noopener">Ted Nelson</a> and a long list of other people, but here I may get more into data and “hyper-data”. Collecting, organizing, curating and augmenting the records/recordings of an online collaboration/conversation group is a frequent topic of discussion, and I would like to start many open, small-scale, transparent, non-competing, non-intrusive, quick, cheap, experimental, practical projects for/on/with ideally <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eginMQBWII4" rel="nofollow noopener">libre-freely licensed data/media</a> (or at least open or public), building small, custom <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html" rel="nofollow noopener">libre-freely licensed software</a> tools, potentially also developing some practices/methodologies/processes as wanted/needed. I’m also more recently considering to eventually build an universal “data manager/browser” of my own around the notion of multidimensionality, and therefore are looking for multidimensional example data, of which there doesn’t seem to be much out there, so why not simply produce some? I’m not necessarily that much into liberating/exporting Jerry’s brain or the typical mind-graphing, but more about neutral data/tool services for supporting collaboration activities hopefully for/at scale, hopefully updating many brains at a time. Also doing some of this anyway, to some extend outside and beyond OGM.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are your superpowers?<br>
Bootstrapping, semantics (technical), a certain style of automatization workflows, editing (almost philological), applying system theory + cybernetics for analyzing and/or designing/implementing systems in order to deal with complexity, maybe?</p>

            <p>Howdy!  Look around and read some posts, then dive in and reply to some topics (or create your own).</p>
<p>For mailing list folks, “Categories” are almost like sub-lists.  “Topics” are like email threads, with a new subject line.</p>
<p>For Slack folks, “Categories” are like Slack channels.  “Topics” are like threads.</p>
<p>For help, post in the “<a href="https://forum.openglobalmind.com/c/start-here/help/8">Help!</a>” category – you can click the “+ New Topic” button, or reply to another topic.</p>
<p>If you get stuck, email Jerry (<a href="mailto:sociate@gmail.com">sociate@gmail.com</a>) or Pete (<a href="mailto:kaminski@istori.com">kaminski@istori.com</a>).</p>
<p>Thank you for being here!</p>
