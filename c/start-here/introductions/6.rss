          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I feel odd about writing this because I’m new and unknown, but I hope it might give people some idea of how I might fit in. I’d be happy to answer questions posed about my experience, education, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Be warned:</strong> This may be more than you wanted, needed or hoped for. <img src="https://forum.openglobalmind.com/images/emoji/apple/stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:"></p>
<p><em><strong>Where on the globe are you?</strong></em> Yes.  Whoops, I mean, Milford, Ohio, USA.</p>
<p><em><strong>What is your main gig?</strong></em> I don’t have one. Having taught English for 10+ years in Indonesia (self-taught teacher), I’ve come to realize just how inadequate English is as an international language, and how vexing it is, too. I enjoy public speaking but I would love to be mentored to become better at it.</p>
<p><em>I’m a(n):</em></p>

            <p><strong>Where on the globe are you?</strong></p>
<p>In Brighton, a beautiful seaside town 1-hr from London. Originally from Budapest, and spent 20 yrs in California. I came here because regarding the culture and nature in Europe, (next to Barcelona) Brighton comes the closest to Santa Cruz, my fave ol’ stomping ground.</p>
<p><strong>What is your main gig?</strong></p>
<p>presently, it’s <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k9t25tYRMrBiN5UdBJ8C7ER7AXUXboogBWVyVExU3ZA/edit" rel="nofollow noopener">SymmaSys</a>, a project of <a href="https://futurehow.site/" rel="nofollow noopener">Future HOW</a>, which will use my Generative Action Research methodology that I wrote about <a href="https://www.academia.edu/33749187/On_the_Verge_of_Collective_Awakening" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a> and will be conducted, hopefully, in collaboration with the Hashverse of CICOlab.</p>
<p><strong>LinkedIn link?</strong> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/georgepor/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.linkedin.com/in/georgepor/</a></p>
<p><strong>What is your connection to OGM?</strong></p>
<p>in one word: <strong>Jerry</strong></p>
<p>in a few more words, from my <strong>“global mind” researcher</strong> side: the “Designing for the Emergence of a Global-scale Collective Intelligence” paper that I <a href="http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/GB-issue/GB-oldstuff/Por3.html" rel="nofollow noopener">presented</a> at a conference in 2001</p>
<p>in a few more words, from  my <strong>“social acupuncturist”</strong> side: the possibility to use my gifts for helping to unblock whatever prevents the energy flow more freely in the social body of OGM</p>
<p>in a few more words, from  my <strong>“future chronicler”</strong> side: what I wrote about in <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hDe5NGcPsbTSxnvUCcRhNXlxFxs7OhSja3ztL6tPeMU/edit" rel="nofollow noopener">my OGM2025 story</a></p>
<p><strong>What part interests you most?</strong></p>
<p>definitely, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicate_and_explicate_order" rel="nofollow noopener">enfolded/implicate part</a>, in David Bohm’s sense</p>
<p><strong>What are your superpowers?</strong></p>
<p>being an evolutionary sherpa (see below)<br>

            <p><strong>Where on the globe are you?</strong>  I am mainly in Arlington VA and spend a lot of time in Bluffton SC (near Savannah GA and Hilton Head SC)</p>
<p><strong>What is your main gig?</strong>  I own and run a Management, Strategy, and Design consultancy (Arc Aspicio) mostly focused on the US government, in particular Homeland Security. <a href="http://www.arcaspicio.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.arcaspicio.com</a></p>
<p><strong>LinkedIn link?</strong>  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/okeeferob/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.linkedin.com/in/okeeferob/</a></p>
<p><strong>What is your connection to OGM?</strong>  I am a long time user of The Brain, on and off over many years. As such I became interested in a variety of Jerry’s initiatives, such as Inside Jerry’s Brain (IJB) chats. Mostly a lurker.</p>
<p><strong>What part interests you most?</strong>  I am a connector. I would like to see this community evolve and then have connections to spiritual/self development communities and Bitcoin communities and art/photography communities. I have an interest in finding news sources that are close to the place the news is happening and are not part of a major media conglomerate.</p>
<p><strong>Extra credit: What are your superpowers?</strong> I am a connector and empathetic. I have poor memory, which is why i use The Brain! Ha!</p>
<p>I like finding new music and sources of music. I think the two party system is broken and damaging in the US. I think the USD based monetary system is broken and damaging to the world.</p>

            <p>I am passionate about making sense of the onslaught of information we receive and taking effective collective action.</p>
<p>A project that might be interesting to this group is building mass agreement with <a href="https://ReasonScore.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Reason Score</a> and <a href="https://GulliBot.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Gulli Bot</a></p>
<ul>
<li>You can see my current projects and all my social media links <a href="https://BentleyDavis.com" rel="nofollow noopener">BentleyDavis.com</a>
</li>
<li>I live in Dallas Texas USA</li>
<li>I like to prototype other people’s passions and build my own startups. I am a contract app/web developer (full stack)</li>
<li>My LinkedIn is <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/bntlyd" rel="nofollow noopener">bntlyd</a>
</li>
<li>My connection to OGM is I have been following Jerry on YouTube for many years and jumped when he introduced OGM.</li>
<li>What part interests you most? How can we have a shared assessment of reality we make collective decisions and actions. I also like build experimental tools.</li>
<li>My superpowers are seeing elegant patters and expressing them to others in a way they can (often) understand. I can also implement those patterns in code and user interfaces.</li>

            <p><strong>Where on the globe are you?</strong>  Living in Bend, Oregon</p>
<p><strong>What is your main gig?</strong> Volunteer for a group of NGOs focused on climate change, specifically as it relates to food and agriculture</p>
<p><strong>LinkedIn link?</strong>  I like to mess around on LI, it’s the best ever free focus group research <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/klaus-mager-47078512/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.linkedin.com/in/klaus-mager-47078512/</a></p>
<p><strong>What is your connection to OGM?</strong>  Several connections in the network</p>
<p><strong>What part interests you most?</strong>  I’m laser focused on anything related to soil. Soil is life, there is more life inside the soil than there is on top of it. Out of soil grow plants that feed other forms of life, give back to it in return. An entirely interdependent system which we are in the process of destroying for lack of understanding. Only we are part of it, committing suicide inadvertently.</p>
<p>Extra credit: What are your superpowers? I have this crazy background starting as a chef, which btw is an awesome skill to have at this time with my favorite restaurants all out of commission. I was working on $billion projects leading teams responsible for anything you could eat or drink, from ideation, design, operational startup, supply chain development, corporate alliances. Also international, my last gig was corporate as head of target group marketing with teams in 30 countries, based out of Germany. Totally in awe with Theory U as a social systems change management tool. It works!</p>

<strong>Where on the globe are you?</strong> Moving soon to Boston, MA</li>

<strong>What is your connection to OGM? What part interests you most?</strong> I met Jerry back in March and the rest is history! I like that OGM provides a place for people who to think, learn, and grow. I just find it so thrilling that the conversations can go from philosophy to somatics to education within 5 minutes. I’m most interested in exploring my own passions and interests alongside others doing the same. Something good has to come out of that.</li>
<li>
<strong>What are your superpowers?</strong> Personally, I’m still figuring that out. I am a deep thinker, good listener, and do things very intentionally. I think that leads to a simple faith in success that I can tap into. I can get enthusiastic about almost anything (within moral boundaries, of course). f you have an idea you want to pursue and you really believe in it, I will do everything I can to make that happen. I try to always look at things from multiple perspectives and have little patience for willful ignorance. To speak tactically, I have a lot of experience designing user flows, developing business cases, coordinating global teams, and the business side of software delivery. As such, I have written my fair share of compelling feature narratives to illustrate the importance of moving a pop-up window <img src="https://forum.openglobalmind.com/images/emoji/apple/slightly_smiling_face.png?v=9" title=":slightly_smiling_face:" class="emoji" alt=":slightly_smiling_face:"> (though I’ve done some more exciting things too).</li>

          <title>Introductions: Peter Kaminski, Kevin Jones</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[peterkaminski]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Introductions</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hello!  I am Peter Kaminski.  Informally, I call myself Pete.</p>
<p>I have a calling to help people of good intent work together to accomplish what they believe to be important. I value knowledge, wisdom, kindness, harmony, wholeness, and gratitude for all living beings. I believe that helping one helps us all, and hurting one hurts us all.</p>
<p>I hope my work on the projects here: helps others work together better; helps others help themselves to accomplish what they believe to be important; creates more knowledge and especially more connections between people; helps heal the world and its beings; furthers my work with personal and collective information spaces; helps me create more artifacts for teaching others about collaboration; and helps me grow my network of friends and colleagues.</p>
<p>Along with personal and collective information spaces, a couple more personal interests that may align: alternative economies; “the matchmaker problem” (as I call it: how might people who have and need things find each other); preparing the world to work together better locally and globally in a changing climate; and intentional communities, and how they sustain and grow and think and remember.</p>
<p>In my professional life, I am a startup entrepreneur and consultant to businesses and nonprofits/NGOs. I do both software product development/deployment, and coaching on collaboration process. I’ve worked on the Internet since 1992, and with computers since 1977.</p>
<p>In my personal life, I am married to the same wonderful woman for 35+ years.  We have two grown kids who were unschooled until university. I enjoy travel, the outdoors, genealogy/family history, photography, music production, and indoor rock climbing.</p>
<p>I’ve lived in the United States, in western Nevada, the San Francisco Bay Area, Southern California, and Washington DC. We currently reside in San Diego.</p>
<p>I have LinkedIn and Facebook profiles, feel free to find me, but I don’t interact much there.</p>

          <dc:creator><![CDATA[skreutzer]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Introductions</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <ol>
<li>
<p>Where on the globe are you?<br>
Germany</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is your main gig?<br>
I’m full-time employed at a dayjob (translates to a shortage when it comes to volunteering time/capacity for OGM, but also to no financial interest).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LinkedIn link?<br>
Not on LinkedIn.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is your connection to OGM?<br>
Tried for a long time to find + join groups or individuals who want to do practical, technical work of the kind mentioned in the OGM meetings, which never worked out for various interesting reasons, and now I hope this has a better chance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What part interests you most?<br>
Usually I’m doing basic work around text, publishing, hypertext, media and hypermedia as pioneered by <a href="https://www.invisiblerevolution.net/video.html" rel="nofollow noopener">Douglas Engelbart</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TheTedNelson/videos?view=0&amp;sort=da&amp;flow=grid" rel="nofollow noopener">Ted Nelson</a> and a long list of other people, but here I may get more into data and “hyper-data”. Collecting, organizing, curating and augmenting the records/recordings of an online collaboration/conversation group is a frequent topic of discussion, and I would like to start many open, small-scale, transparent, non-competing, non-intrusive, quick, cheap, experimental, practical projects for/on/with ideally <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eginMQBWII4" rel="nofollow noopener">libre-freely licensed data/media</a> (or at least open or public), building small, custom <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html" rel="nofollow noopener">libre-freely licensed software</a> tools, potentially also developing some practices/methodologies/processes as wanted/needed. I’m also more recently considering to eventually build an universal “data manager/browser” of my own around the notion of multidimensionality, and therefore are looking for multidimensional example data, of which there doesn’t seem to be much out there, so why not simply produce some? I’m not necessarily that much into liberating/exporting Jerry’s brain or the typical mind-graphing, but more about neutral data/tool services for supporting collaboration activities hopefully for/at scale, hopefully updating many brains at a time. Also doing some of this anyway, to some extend outside and beyond OGM.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are your superpowers?<br>
Bootstrapping, semantics (technical), a certain style of automatization workflows, editing (almost philological), applying system theory + cybernetics for analyzing and/or designing/implementing systems in order to deal with complexity, maybe?</p>

            <p>Howdy!  Look around and read some posts, then dive in and reply to some topics (or create your own).</p>
<p>For mailing list folks, “Categories” are almost like sub-lists.  “Topics” are like email threads, with a new subject line.</p>
<p>For Slack folks, “Categories” are like Slack channels.  “Topics” are like threads.</p>
<p>For help, post in the “<a href="https://forum.openglobalmind.com/c/start-here/help/8">Help!</a>” category – you can click the “+ New Topic” button, or reply to another topic.</p>
<p>If you get stuck, email Jerry (<a href="mailto:sociate@gmail.com">sociate@gmail.com</a>) or Pete (<a href="mailto:kaminski@istori.com">kaminski@istori.com</a>).</p>
<p>Thank you for being here!</p>
