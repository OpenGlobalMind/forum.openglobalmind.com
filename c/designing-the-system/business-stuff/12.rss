            <p>" Dynamic Equity Split" is an equity allocation mechanism that was heavily discussed a few years ago in the US entrepreneurial/startup space.</p>
<p>I never really dug into it, but want to at some point.  This is a reminder to look into it more, and a pointer for others who might be interested.</p>
<p>Here’s one starter article, there are many others about the topic:</p>

          <title>Commerce and OGM</title>

            <p>I wanted to discuss commerce and OGM a little, following up from my mention of the topic on the Thursday, 2020-09-01 OGM call.</p>
<p>Partly, I just wanted to say out loud that I think we should, sometimes, pay each other real money for goods and services.  There are other commerce+OGM topics, too, would love to discuss those as well.</p>
<p>Also, I want to make this observation right up front: it’s common in our society to want to maximize revenue/profit/etc.  But I’m less interested in that kind of commerce within OGM.</p>
<p>I prefer thinking of internal commerce more as a way to start discussions about value exchange (of many kinds, not just money) and a way for us to do stigmergic signaling, and not necessarily as a primary income (or cost) stream.  So for instance, in an OGM Marketplace, I might offer or accept US$10 for 1 hour of some kind of work, even though in another market that hour might be worth US$100.  (Or blended value, some in $, some in BTC, some in exchange value, some in OGM Bucks, etc., etc.)</p>
<p>I think a good start might be a “Marketplace” category within OGM Forum, with sub-categories like “Help Wanted”, “Help Offered”, “Stuff Wanted”, “Stuff Offered”.</p>
<p>What do <em>you</em> think about commerce and OGM?</p>

            <p>OGM is about being as open as possible, and open-sourcing as much as possible.</p>
<p>That said, it is also a place for people to make a living, so it needs some business models.</p>
<p>One early example is the notion of StoryThreaders, which we talked about <a href="https://youtu.be/M2l43ol0so0">in this call</a>. Who would like to be a test-pilot StoryThreader? How might we sell a StoryThreading gig?</p>
