            <p>Hi all:</p>
<p>I am creating activity diagrams on what OGM does.  I seek feedback.   I have heard that the high-level goal of OGM is to solve the worlds major problems.</p>
<p>Agree?   What is the approach?</p>

            <p>Balaji describes a new form of country emerging. An example that made me think…</p>
<p>Amazon and some other companies have power to negotiate with existing localities to negotiate rules and exceptions (no taxes, special treatment). What if 1000 or 10,000 people formed a consortium with governance and expectations and committed resources (likely crypto currency in a smart contract), could they negotiate new rules too. Could this evolve into being new “countries” (using quotes as they would be something else not in existence yet).</p>
<p>I am totally butchering this, but hopefully you get the idea. From this podcast episode…</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>For designing ourselves into being as a thriving and anti-fragile community/movement, I suggest we develop a source document, a next-stage, not-ossified, living “constitution,” defined as follows. It was developed by a friend of mine and used in my community-building work, over the last 30 years in many settings.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What Is a Source Document?</strong></p>
<p>SOURCE: “that from which something arises; a wellspring.”  Source refers to the basic elements from which something emerges.  It applies to those things that are continually emergent, that have lives of their own, that generate their own shape and identity.  To see the source of something, we need to understand <strong>the basic elements and their interplay, their dynamic relationships, which are key to its current identity and to what it might become.</strong></p>
<p>DOCUMENT: “any text that can be referred to by a community independent of its originators in time and space.”  It is therefore available as a record of origin and, at the same time, as the source of dialogue and interpretation that are continually evolving.  It enables us to relate current circumstances and current development to original intentions.  This provides us with <strong>a connection to the history and identity of our institutions while not locking us into rigid rules of fixed interpretations of earlier times.</strong></p>
<p>A well-formed source document provides a structure of interpretation that demands continued engagement, intelligence and independent interpretation in the face of the varying circumstances of life.</p>
<p>Source: Mike McMaster’s  talk on “EMERGENCE, SELF-ORGANISATION AND FREEDOM: the sources of innovation” at the Complexity &amp; Innovation conference, London 1997</p>

          <title>K.Gardeners Circle</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Technoshaman]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Organizing OGM</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I noticed that we have a number of topics in which the purpose of OGM is discussed, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://forum.openglobalmind.com/t/ogm-workshop-group-1-output/413/6" class="inline-onebox">OGM Workshop Group 1 output</a></li>
<li><a href="https://forum.openglobalmind.com/t/core-purpose/414" class="inline-onebox">Core purpose</a></li>
<li><a href="https://forum.openglobalmind.com/t/so-exactly-why-are-we-here-what-is-it-that-most-needs-being-done/127" class="inline-onebox">So, exactly WHY are we here? What is it that most needs being done?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>No, I didn’t open this topic as yet another space to address it, just the opposite — to call our attention to the fact that when the same subject is addressed in different containers, it increases the likelihood that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>People, who don’t notice or can’t follow all the conversations about the  same at different places, will miss some valuable contributions, get confused about where to post their own contribution, and get disconnected from the flow of productive engagement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Collective sensemaking, self-reflection, memory, and intelligence are becoming increasingly difficult to nourish, due to the balkanization of the discussion about the same subject.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>That situation is unavoidable in every virtual community without proper facilitation and knowledge gardening. It’s not really an issue in socmedia groups, where cultivating collective sensemaking, self-reflection, memory and intelligence is not part of the group’s aspirations and culture. The situation is  exacerbated when:</p>
<ul>
<li>The same group of people are using different platforms with quasi-identical affordances (e.g. Discourse and Mattermost) for conversing about poorly differentiated subjects (e.g. <a href="https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/agora/channels/tools--technology" rel="nofollow noopener">Tools on Mattermost</a>  and <a href="https://forum.openglobalmind.com/c/designing-the-system/tools/10">Tools on Discourse</a> ).</li>
<li>New topics are opening without a well-defined reason for being posted in the topic opener.</li>
<li>New topics are opening without a host helping the convo to go somewhere vs. endless meandering.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hoping that some order will emerge from the looming crisis of our collective epistemology (that “roughly, refers to the study of the epistemological properties of groups and the significance of group knowledge production and acquisition” (<a href="https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/essays-in-collective-epistemology/" rel="nofollow noopener">source</a> )?</p>
<p>Me too, <em>and</em> I also think that we may even be able to prevent the crisis. In fact, that’s why I’m opening this “Knowledge Gardeners Circle” topic with the intended purpose to attract enough people to a productive conversation about forming a community of knowledge gardeners dedicated to cultivating the collective intelligence of the OGM initiative.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I do not offer to be the leader/coordinator of the suggested circle. I will be happy to be a member of KGC and act as a coach to it if the need that it is intended to serve gets enough traction and at least 3-5 people want to participate in it. I also offer to facilitate this topic until the circle is formally established and or the lack of sufficient support for it becomes evident.</p>

          <title>Roles, redux</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[holtzermann17]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Organizing OGM</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I’d like to run through the Roles described on the <a href="https://www.openglobalmind.com/about/team/roles" rel="nofollow noopener">OGM webpage</a> and see how they match the nascent pattern language that is <a href="https://forum.openglobalmind.com/t/ogm-workshop-group-1-output/413">OGM Workshop Group 1 output</a>.</p>
<p><strong>A. Sensors</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sensors fulfill the primary research function of OGM. The primary responsibility of a sensor is to grow our knowledge base. Consider them similar to <strong>market research analysts</strong> responsible for key subject areas. They scan the environment and the world, searching for new thoughts, ideas, and insights to bring into the system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This seems related to <a href="https://forum.openglobalmind.com/t/defining-characteristics/415"><strong>Defining Characteristics</strong> : <em>Maps of the landscape</em></a> — insofar as sensors are also like “scouts” or “surveyors”; and furthermore, the map-making project influences the “view” of the landscape.</p>
<p><strong>B. Protectors</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Owners of how OGM interfaces with the outside world. Their responsibilities include API’s, IP, access controls, cyber security, membership, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although the quote above is mostly technically worded, it sounds a lot like <a href="https://forum.openglobalmind.com/t/scope-of-work/417"> <strong>Scope of Work</strong> : <em>Debug individual and joint activities</em></a>, insofar as the “scope” of work defines a <em>boundary</em> and the boundary helps protect the organisation (I’m thinking of Stafford Beer’s model of the firm, and Ronald Coase’s).  It’s interesting to think of the “debugging” process as a form of immune system, as well, of which the boundary is only one part.</p>
<p><strong>C. Fellows</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Investors, leaders, and thought-provokers. To be a Fellow suggests a <strong>deeper level of partnership</strong> with OGM. These individuals (or organizations) grow and advance the fundamental mechanisms that support OGM. They help provide or procure funding for the pursuit of new projects and help guide thought leadership.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now this sounds a bit like <a href="https://forum.openglobalmind.com/t/values/416"> <strong>Values</strong> : <em>Practices of stewardship</em></a>.  The “deeper level” of partnership sounds like it may well involve a “stewardship” role. Or, put otherwise, these roles might feed into and sustain the “values” of the organization itself. One keeps in mind that “funding” and “Financial Capital” is only one of seven Community Captials!  The “thought leadership” might be along any of the other dimensions. This <a href="https://jods.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/resisting-reduction/release/17" rel="nofollow noopener">essay</a> by Joi Ito might be worth reading in connection with these themes.</p>

<p><strong>D. Makers (Builders)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The primary function of the “Makers”, or “Creators” is to create – or shepherd the creation of – tools and services.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although the link is a bit lose, I wonder if this is connected with <a href="https://forum.openglobalmind.com/t/strategic-objectives/419"><strong>Strategic Objectives</strong> : <em>Ongoing learning (w/ a shared memory artifact) and unlearning</em></a>, since the strategic objectives contribute to an articulation of the project, and as such are “tools for thought.”  Another thing that the makers <em>make</em> is memory.  Am I reaching too much here…?</p>
<p><em>We are the music makers,</em><br>
&nbsp;    <em>And we are the dreamers of dreams,</em><br>
<em>Wandering by lone sea-breakers,</em><br>
&nbsp;    <em>And sitting by desolate streams;—</em><br>
<em>World-losers and world-forsakers,</em><br>
&nbsp;    <em>On whom the pale moon gleams:</em><br>
<em>Yet we are the movers and shakers</em><br>
&nbsp;    <em>Of the world for ever, it seems.</em></p>
<p><strong>E. StoryThreaders</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The story-tellers of the group seek to make connections across multiple narratives, nodes, ideas, or strings of thought. They find creative ways to introduce these new stories to the global consciousness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This seems related to <a href="https://forum.openglobalmind.com/t/sustainability-model/421"> <strong>Sustainability Model</strong> : <em>Develop collective wisdom</em></a> — as I understand it.  (Thanks to <a class="mention" href="/u/kenhomer">@kenhomer</a>, <a class="mention" href="/u/jerry">@Jerry</a>, and <a class="mention" href="/u/mila">@Mila</a> for explaining to me what they mean by “story”.)  What I’m piecing together is that stories are “sustaining” because they are a kind of ground for mindfulness and discernment.  It was also interesting to learn that <a class="mention" href="/u/maparent">@maparent</a> that he recently read “After Buddhism” — a book that’s built mostly out of stories.</p>
<p><strong>F. Participants</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Users of OGM platform who may be makers, story threaders, protectors, or sensors in their own rights.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is an exact match for <a href="https://forum.openglobalmind.com/t/participants/418"> <strong>Participants</strong> : <em>Maintain sufficient cohesion to generate value</em></a>. I emphasised the need for “cohesion” and pulling together different resources (similar to the multiple capitals theory mentioned above, or the metaphor of a kombucha-like functionality of the map-makers/scouts mentioned above under <strong>Sensors</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>G. Sponsors</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Members who support OGM in the form of grants, scholarships, sponsorships, time, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This seems related to <a href="https://forum.openglobalmind.com/t/core-purpose/414"><strong>Core Purpose</strong> : <em>Connect the connectors to what they need to thrive</em></a> as I understood it.  People would “sponsor” the project by providing these needed resources.</p>
<p><strong>H. Advisors</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Members who offer guidance or advice to OGM. Perhaps more of a steering committee.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wonder if the steering committee might take charge of the <a href="https://forum.openglobalmind.com/t/ogm-workshop-group-1-output/413"><strong>Key Operating Principles and Practices</strong> : <em>Online with intention, and in the world with compassion</em></a> — after all, if they are going to “steer” or “operate” the project, they will need access to such a control system!</p>
<p><strong>Guild Members</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Membership in a guild <strong>distinguishes those that can be leveraged</strong> for guidance, advice, or inventive solutions in a given discipline or practice from other participants. An all-encompassing role, Guild Members are master practitioners of OGM capabilities. They are builders of the product, solution designers, and engagement seekers. Think of Guild Members as <strong>SME</strong>’s. For example, a developer with extensive experience developing API’s might be a guild member of an API-related guild. Similarly, a story-threader may be a member of a related guild. Furthermore, guild membership is not mutually exclusive. That is to say, a story-threader can belong to a “Builder” guild or a “Story-Threader” guild.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Personally, I’m a bit less charmed by this “guild” language and have suggested  “<a href="https://forum.openglobalmind.com/t/guilds-which-ones/65/9">working groups</a>” as a more down-to-earth alternative term. That said, maybe the guild term means something important that I’m not grasping (as was the case with “story” until it was explained to me).  However, the other point to make at this juncture is that I have run out of link targets.  So, in the words of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Simon_Laplace" rel="nofollow noopener">Pierre-Simon Laplace</a>: <em>je n’avais pas besoin de cette hypothèse.</em></p>

          <title>OGM as an innovation architecture &amp; ecosystem</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Technoshaman]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Organizing OGM</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>In team 4 of our design workshop, last Friday, I said something about concurrent and integrated cultivation of the following domains of <em>OGM as an innovation architecture</em>: social/cultural, business/organizational, knowledge/learning, and technology architectures.</p>
<p>That’s a framework that I’ve been using in my organization design work. Its emphasis is on their <em>concurrent and integrated cultivation,</em> the sweet spot of their overlap that can generate the highest payoff.</p>
<p><img src="https://forum.openglobalmind.com/uploads/default/original/1X/9d672bbc478cfc614458559686c99d5f8624bbc7.png" alt="Screenshot 2020-10-31 at 06.12.35" data-base62-sha1="mss0kDF6WPJEopzydMPfcWLqUv5" width="307" height="285"></p>
<p>When the propeller blades start turning, they trigger a wind of continuous renewal and the ripple effects of innovation introduced in one area on the other areas.</p>
<p>We can think of the OGM <em>innovation architecture</em> as a <strong>vessel</strong> to carry and amplify the <strong>energy</strong> generated by OGM as an <em>innovation ecosystem.</em></p>
<p>I visualize that innovation ecosystem as a rainforest of many projects initiatives, communities, organizations, which are all expressions of our individual and communal creativity.</p>
<p>Striving for simultaneously moving the edge of innovation in all those areas, OGM could reach a high level of coherence and synergy across the projects that we’ll be engaged in.</p>
<p>I guess, in our gang of many “big picture” thinkers and doers, there are already a good number of high-level organizing frameworks floating around. This one is not intended to compete with any of them. If it gains traction, it can be used as a corollary to them.</p>

            <p>If we design it well, i.e. for fulfilling its highest potential, then  OGM will become a large-scale Complex Adaptive Social Systems (CASS).</p>
<p>A CASS is sharing the features of other Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) and also differs from them. Given that, wouldn’t be it be useful considering, early in the design process:</p>
<ul>
<li>what we can learn from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_adaptive_system#General_properties" rel="nofollow noopener">properties</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_adaptive_system#Characteristics" rel="nofollow noopener">characteristics</a> of CAS</li>
<li>what insights we can glean from the ways in which a CASS differs from CAS</li>
<li>some principles of evolutionary entrepreneurship as they may relate to OGM (see: <a href="https://www.kosmosjournal.org/article/evolutionary-entrepreneurship-engaging-collective-will/" rel="nofollow noopener">Evolutionary Entrepreneurship — Engaging Collective Will</a> ).</li>
</ul>
<p>If the answer to my question is yes, and such considerations are deemed useful, then who would have the appetite to inquire into them with me?</p>

            <p>How should we organize ourselves? What roles should we define? Should we have guilds? If so, which? If not, how else to organize along interest or skill lines?</p>
