          <title>History of Web Annotation</title>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I wanted to start a resource topic about the history of web annotation.</p>
<p>Back in the day, I hung out with some of the people (centered around Ka-Ping Yee) doing Crit/CritSuite, but much info of which has link-rotted away:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://foresight.org/WebEnhance/">Enhancing the World Wide Web</a></li>
<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010421051642/http://crit.org/~ping/ht98.html">CritLink: Better Hyperlinks for the WWW</a></li>
</ul>
<p>A little later, there was Third Voice:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~ids/dotdot/misc/research_related/AnnotatingTheWeb/locally_hosted_annotations/CritSuite_got_there_before_Third_Voice.html">CritSuite got there before Third Voice!</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I remember using Third Voice a little, too.</p>
<p>Nowadays, there is Hypothesis:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://web.hypothes.is/">Hypothesis</a></li>
</ul>
<p>One of the wonderments of the WWW for me is that web annotation has never become first class.</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="/u/holtzermann17">@holtzermann17</a>, sort of posting this for you; I already posted it to the mailing list and to CSC Agora, but I don’t think you’re on either of those right now.  And some of this event might appeal to you.</p>
<p>Also for anyone else, of course!</p>
<p><strong>Good virtual event for the tech folks, organized by DWeb Meetup SF. Thursday 5pm PST, 8pm EST, 2am CET.</strong> (Time was specifically chosen for this event to be Asia-friendly; sorry Europe!) <strong>Free/donate registration through Eventbrite required.</strong></p>

<p>Hear from 12 Projects: challenges, milestones &amp; lessons learned</p>
<p>Even amidst the COVID lockdown, builders of the Decentralized Web have hit new milestones. At our next DWeb Meetup, we will hear from a dozen projects about their breakthroughs, challenges, and roadmaps for the coming year. As with all of our DWeb Meetups, these lightning talks will provide an opportunity to learn from others and explore potential partnerships and collaboration. (We ask for less “product pitch” and more sharing important lessons.)</p>
<p>Join us for lightning rounds of 5 minute talks with 2 minutes of Q&amp;A in Zoom. Afterwards we will head to Gather.town for socializing and networking.</p>
<p>Here are some of the 12 Presenters:</p>
<p>Mauve Signweaver, Founder, Agregore</p>
<p>Agregore: Local-First Web Of Everything</p>
<p>Agregore is a local-first web browser which aims to simplify application development across different peer-to-peer protocols while staying as minimal and customizable as possible.</p>
<p>Twitter: <span class="mention">@RangerMauve</span></p>
<p>Tom Trowbridge, Founder, Fluence Labs</p>
<p>Fluence Labs was established in 2017 by 3 founders, Dmitry Kurinskiy, Tom Trowbridge and Evgeny Ponomarev. Fluence Labs has developed an open application platform that leverages blockchain to enable new software business models. Applications share data and users and are radically easier to create, allowing developers to build on each other and be rewarded as their services and applications are used.</p>
<p>Twitter: <span class="mention">@Fluence_Project</span></p>
<p>Maria Bustillos, Co-Founder, Brick House Co-operative</p>
<p>Megaplatforms from Amazon to Facebook to Penguin Random House have flattened and centralized the human imagination. The Brick House Cooperative, launching December 8th, is addressing this problem as writers and artists, ‘from the other side’. They’re looking to join forces with technologists and others interested in decorporatizing media. Maria will also share how her previous experience with Civil, a blockchain-based media platform that aimed to fund journalism, will inform her work with The Brick House.</p>
<p>Twitter: <span class="mention">@mariabustillos</span></p>
<p>Dietrich Ayala, Ecosystem Lead, IPFS</p>
<p>Big is Small is Big: IPFS Usage, Users and Use-cases in 2020</p>
<p>As adoption and availability of IPFS grew in 2020, we saw it used across a broad spectrum of applications, varying widely in industry category, use-case, architecture and more. IPFS ecosystem lead Dietrich Ayala will speedrun through a sampling of these, sharing what was learned and how our users are guiding the IPFS project into 2021.</p>
<p>Twitter: <span class="mention">@dietrich</span></p>
<p>Karissa McKelvey, Researcher, Simply Secure</p>
<p>Decentralization Off The Shelf: Patterns x Decentralized Applications</p>
<p>It’s hard to get started building a decentralized application. Even if you’ve been building them for years, it’s hard to get them adopted. Decentralized applications operate differently than centralized ones — and we need new tools that developers and designers can use to understand how to build applications. Simply Secure is now producing a library of resources, assets, and patterns to support the design and development of better user-facing applications that are backed by decentralized architecture.</p>
<p>Twitter: <span class="mention">@okdistribute</span></p>
<p>Adam Souzis, One Commons</p>
<p>“At the DWeb Camp in 2019, I led a brainstorming session on how we can build a cloud providing the same openness and freedoms to users and developers as open source. One year and a pandemic later, I’m excited to finally release the first step in pursuit of that vision: “ensembles,” git repositories that package open cloud services. They are designed to be the building blocks of an open and decentralized cloud infrastructure: reproducible, relocatable and shareable. Decentralization is obtained via a notion of a persistent identity that is defined not by a network location but rather a reproducible state.”</p>
<p><span class="mention">@onecommons</span></p>
<p>Travis Vachon – ItMe.company (The first Co-op Data union built on top of SOLID)</p>
<p>Centralized tech monopolies and other large corporations capture the vast majority of the value of the world’s data in 2020. In order to create the conditions necessary to return this value to the world’s users, we need new politico-technical-social institutions that give users the ability to provide and retract informed consent over the ways their data is used. itme is building the world’s first cooperatively owned and operated data union built on Tim Berners-Lee’s new Solid web standard to let users reassemble their digital bodies and capture the value of the data they create.</p>

<p>Brandon Wallace, &amp; Drew O’Meara, PLAN Systems</p>
<p>PLAN Systems is a technology 501©(3) founded in 2018 by two U.S. veterans in Austin TX. Their development effort centers on building a framework of open protocols and universally accessible interfaces designed for privacy, real time collaboration, data visualization, and secure data storage &amp; portability. November was a critical milestone, demonstrating PLAN (pre-alpha) running on 4 major platforms across desktop and mobile devices.</p>

<p>Paul Frazee, Founder, Beaker Browser</p>
<p>Beaker Browser 1.0: Share P2P Websites</p>
<p>Unless there was a disaster between now and Thursday, then Beaker Browser 1.0 will be available! Join us for a quick overview of building and sharing peer-to-peer Websites with this newest release.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@pfrazee</span> <a href="https://beakerbrowser.com">https://beakerbrowser.com</a></p>
<p>Mark Nadal, Founder, Gun.eco</p>
<p>Founded in 2014, GUN is an open source cybersecurity protocol for synchronizing graph data in decentralized mesh networks. It is as easy as Firebase yet supports end-to-end encryption and uses “CRDT” algorithms instead of a Blockchain.</p>
<p>In 2020, GUN hit 200M+ downloads with 30M monthly active users. The project is powered by 2 full time staff, 10 part-time volunteers, and 100+ contributors.</p>
<p>Twitter: <span class="mention">@marknadal</span></p>
<p>Yisi Liu, Founder, DWeb Meetup Shanghai</p>
<p>The DWeb Shanghai group co-hosted a workshop on mesh network building. We joined with the Institute of Network Society at China Academy of Art as a special workshop of its fifth annual conference. I will share an overview of this mesh networking workshop and what we learned.</p>

<p>Use the “link” at the bottom of any post to create a “linked discussion”.</p>
<p>But this then needs to be taught to people who use this site so that they don’t hijack threads with clutter.</p>

<p>This is just one repo: I can imagine for bigger projects (10000’s of nodes) we would want to break it across multiple repositories, and probably invest in some more data intensive tooling.  I’m not sure where things are “at” with the Free Jerry’s Brain effort but this gives a taste of something that seems directly usable now by both “technical” and “nontechnical” users who are willing to spend a few minutes learning.  Of course, many technical improvements would be possible later.</p>
<p>If people would like to join in on the Peeragogy site as coauthors, or just for a tour, that could be arranged!</p>
<p>BTW also, Logseq is now directly interoperable with Org Roam in emacs, after a simple bugfix and corresponding change to the config file.<br>

<p>Logseq is a Roam-like thing in the browser that supports both Markdown and Org Mode. It uses Github as a backing store, which means that you can use it both in the browser, and via Emacs + (Ma)Git.  As of this bug fix Logseq seems to have good...</p>

            <p>I think I screwed up associating logseq with a new repo “commentsPlus”. I did not notice that the primary branch is named “main”, not “master”.</p>
<p>So logseq is associated as an app with some repo on a non-existent master branch. Is there some way to find it and clean it up? Maybe remove the app association?</p>
<p>I am a bit lost here.</p>

<p>A new personal CRM.  Looks pretty and well-designed, although nothing I haven’t imagined for a personal CRM.</p>
<p>There’s a waitlist to “reserve” a spot, but after I entered my email, it told me I could sign up right away, at $20/month.  I passed for now, but will keep an eye on it.</p>
<p>I have a couple more screenshots than what is on the website – if you’re interested, send me an email backchannel and I can forward.</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Checking in on how to do community payments in the year of 2020. (I can’t believe this is still not yet a big successful thing, but whatever.)</p>
<h2>LETS, Time Banks</h2>
<p>LETS (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_exchange_trading_system">local exchange trading system</a>), particularly the open source ones (openLETS, SimpleLETS, WebLETS, LETS Connector), seem to have basically withered and died. (SimpleLETS  <em>is</em>  under active dev, but it’s alpha.)</p>
<p>Time banks may be a little less obsolete.</p>
<p>Also see: <a href="https://www.letsf.org.uk/resources/links/lets-software/">LETS Software</a>, Circular Multilateral Barter, <a href="https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Complementary_Currency_Software">Complementary Currency Software</a>, <a href="https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Timebanking_Software_Platforms">Timebanking Software Platforms</a>.</p>
<h2>RipplePay</h2>
<p>RipplePay, now RumplePay, has always been interesting, and Ryan Fugger is still running the RumplePay server, although in his announcement of the name change on 2020-08-26, he writes, “So I’ve changed the name to Rumplepay. I hope that feels familiar enough, and also communicates the benign neglect that the site has seen since, oh, about 2008…”</p>
<p>He also notes that <a href="https://villages.io/">Villages IO</a> is running a Rumple-ish site (although its for a locality).</p>
<p>Separately, this: “<a href="https://fiatjaf.alhur.es/rumple.html">idea: Rumple</a>”, which is sort of a mashup of RumplePay and Lightning, looks really interesting, but it’s currently just an idea.</p>
<h2>Crypto</h2>
<p>Maybe a community altcoin?</p>
<p>After just a short bit of reflection, I think the way to do this is not with an altcoin, but to issue a community-based ERC-20 token. A few initial funders could back the token by buying most or all of the initial minting with fiat.</p>
<p>There are token creation services now:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://coinmechanic.io/">CoinMechanic</a></li>
<li><a href="https://tokenmint.io/">TokenMint</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Or DYI, <a href="https://www.toptal.com/ethereum/create-erc20-token-tutorial">How to Create an ERC20 Token the Simple Way</a>.</p>
<p>And now there is <a href="https://uniswap.org/">Uniswap</a>, a decentralized protocol for automated liquidity provision on Ethereum, in case you want to exchange your tokens for something more liquid.</p>
<p>An ERC-20 token might work well, but would still have the huge disadvantage that users would have to use and maintain a compatible wallet.</p>
<p>Also see: <a href="https://crypt0trad3r46.medium.com/erc20-token-generator-comparison-5d5e2d24ca49">ERC20 token generator comparison</a>, <a href="https://www.stateofthedapps.com/dapps?tags=tokenization">State of the DApps — Tokenization</a>.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Pickings are still pretty slim. An ERC-20 token would be a lot of fun, but a hassle for anybody who doesn’t want to wrangle a wallet and all the short- and long-term issues associated with it.</p>

            <p>I’m writing down some starter patterns for [[Community Marketplaces]]. I’ve been thinking about these in the context of design and <a href="https://forum.openglobalmind.com/t/how-to-participate-in-the-ogm-marketplace/348">how to participate in the OGM Marketplace</a>; and for a longer time, in the context of [[matchmaking systems]], community currencies, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_retail">history of retail markets</a>).</p>
<h2>Forums</h2>
<h3>Goods Needed (Requests)</h3>
<h3>Goods Offered (Offers)</h3>
<h3>Help Needed (Requests)</h3>
<h3>Help Offered (Offers)</h3>
<h3>Reviews and Ratings</h3>
<h2>Policies Needed</h2>
<h3>Ground Rules</h3>
<p>What’s allowed, what’s disallowed?</p>
<p>This is a good place to remind people to follow all laws.</p>
<h3>Payments</h3>
<p>Allowed, not allowed, which currencies / tokens / barter systems / etc. are recommended, disallowed, etc.</p>
<h3>Problem Resolution</h3>
<p>How will problems / disputes be handled? By whom? What recourses are there?</p>
<h3>Reviews / Ratings</h3>
<p>How does the community let members know if an exchange was good or bad? How do good or bad actors get surfaced?</p>
<p>Meta: how do you keep reviews and ratings high in signal, and low in socially obligated noise?</p>
<h3>Timebox</h3>
<p>Nobody likes a stale marketplace. How long do postings last? Are they archived or deleted? Can they be reposted?</p>

            <p>(<a class="mention" href="/u/technoshaman">@Technoshaman</a>,  pinging you because I know you’re using Obsidian, but this note is for all.)</p>
<p>I have a longer post I want to write about this, but I also wanted to post the gist ASAP, so <strong>here you go</strong>.  As such, this post will be missing details, but let me know if I can answer questions, which would help me write the longer post anyway!</p>
<p>I tried [[Roam]], and while I appreciate it, it’s not for me.</p>
<p>I tried [[Obsidian]], and I like it a lot.  I started moving stuff into it (and was able to just a previous set of Markdown-wiki into it with no problems!)</p>
<p>Last week, I tried <a href="https://giffmex.org/stroll/stroll.html">Stroll</a>, and I <strong>love</strong> it.  It is my new favorite, and I feel like I can do all I was doing with Obsidian, but better and more cleanly.  I’m switching to Stroll.  (Aside about TiddlyRoam: it’s based on TiddlyBlink, which is the deprecated tool that preceded Stroll, by the same author.  I decided to go with Stroll, but YMMV.)</p>
<p>Note, Stroll doesn’t quite support a network diagram like Obsidian.  You can install a TiddlyMap plugin, and the Stroll author has some tips to get it to work, while also saying very plainly that he does not support them working together.  I haven’t been using a network visualizer anyway, so I don’t mind.</p>
<p>The “A stroll through Stroll” walkthrough is very helpful, and also serves as a pretty good introduction to TiddlyWiki 5 (which underlies Stroll).</p>
<p>A big first hurdle is figuring out how you’ll save (and load) your Stroll / TiddlyWiki.  I ended up choosing the GitLab saver.  (After trying the GitHub saver, which interacts with TW5 to create 409 errors not infrequently. GitLab has been working well instead.)  Just the HTML5 file saver is fine for infrequent saves, but for my main second brain, I really need to have autosave on.  To use a Git saver, you need a repo in the cloud, but you don’t really need to know Git besides that.  When you do reload your Stroll, you <strong>do</strong> have to remember to get the most recent version from the repo, either in the web interface (or if you know Git, you can have a local repo, just make sure to pull before loading the file in your browser).</p>
<p>The other thing I added was the Markdown plugin, which works well after the fix in the “Troubleshooting” tab of the “stroll through Stroll” walkthrough.  N.B., I think the Relink plugin does <strong>not</strong> rewrite Markdown links, so I’m trying to use more TW5 native page types, rather than Markdown pages.  (If you want Markdown, grab the Markdown plugin from this page, the link is broken in the plugin catalog: <a href="https://tiddlywiki.com/plugins/tiddlywiki/markdown/">markdowndemo</a>.)</p>
<p>[Aside: TiddlyWiki could take over the world, <strong>except</strong> that it’s basically single-player.  (Modulo some experiments with PouchDB/CouchDB, i.e., <a href="https://noteself.org/">NoteSelf</a>.)  A topic for another time.]</p>

<div class="tweet"> An underdocumented part of Japan's video game history: arcades had (and, to an extent, have!) communal notebooks in which people would write game tips, comments, ask questions, and generally communicate – GameFAQs before GameFAQs! These were core for Japan arcades' social aspect.</div>

            <p>I can expand more on how or why to do this if anybody’s interested, but to put it concisely, if <code>$i</code> is your short TheBrain link, then:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">curl -s `curl -Ls -I -w %{url_effective} $i | sed 's#app.thebrain.com#api.thebrain.com/api-v11#'` | jq ".data.attributes.name"

<p>So:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">curl -s `curl -Ls -I -w %{url_effective} https://bra.in/9jQg6m | sed 's#app.thebrain.com#api.thebrain.com/api-v11#'` | jq ".data.attributes.name"

<div class="tweet"> In video meetings it's a hassle to unmute just to say one word especially if someone else is speaking. I created a video lens that uses hand gestures to show comic-book style messages instead. So far it's been pretty fun! https://t.co/wp6XO5QDQc</div>

            <p>to reflect here a bit on the state of current OGM prototyping (as reflected in the tools we’ve decided to use and are maybe desiring to hack with somewhat…weekly zoom chats, utube, gmail, discourse, roam, kumu…) what does work (motivates, engages) and what doesn’t work, (stifles, feels limiting, switches you off) for y’all in this moment?<br>
thank you <a class="mention" href="/u/peterkaminski">@peterkaminski</a> for the prompt in the last weekly call to start building and prototyping at whatever small level…starting with (identifying) what we have to use and any small improvements (hacks) we could be making…</p>

<p>I thought we might be slinging some experimental code and might want a shared place to host it. My preference would be a GitHub Organization.</p>
<p>Any suggestions or concerns?</p>

            <p>I am always looking for tools to bring forward independent sources of news and journalism.</p>
<p><a href="https://kinzen.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">Kinzen</a> was an end user app, but they are shifting to be a publisher oriented tool.</p>
<p><a href="https://civil.co/" rel="nofollow noopener">Civil</a> is/was an online platform for independent journalism, that now is going under the blockchain company ConsenSys.</p>
<p>Maybe not such a good sign that my two examples have both pivoted out of their initial spaces.</p>
<p>I want to keep this post on Tools, but we should start a discussion on how to increase the Demand for independent news, how to fund it, and one or more frameworks for describing sources (I am trying not to use the word “evaluating” or other judgement based words).</p>
<p>I may have other news sources and tools in my Brain, will look later. Open for other examples to be posted.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
Rob.</p>

            <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>Quite a few people have mentioned that they would like to know where everyone is, what their interests are, superpowers, etc. While this information will exist in our “Introductions” page, that information could get buried. I’d love to see if we could build our own! I’ve got some ideas bouncing around in my head that I will put into some Google documents to share with those interested. I’d love to discuss the feasibility of the idea, whether it would be scalable, etc.</p>
