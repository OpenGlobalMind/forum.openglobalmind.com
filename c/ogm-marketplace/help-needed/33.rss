            <p>Continuing the discussion from <a href="https://forum.openglobalmind.com/t/sold-be-a-beat-reporter-for-ogm-forum/350/18">[sold] Be a "beat reporter" for OGM Forum</a>:</p>
<p>Hi, I’d like to pitch another task following the same basic outlines as Peter’s offer, except instead of summarising the OGM forum, this job is to summarise the <strong>OGM mailing list</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Details (mostly stolen from Peter):</p>
<p>Hi, I hereby offer US$50 (in USD or cryptocurrency) for someone to spend 1-2 hours per week for 4 weeks to browse through the OGM Mailing List, see what’s interesting, what’s going on, what needs more discussion, possible connections between threads, etc.</p>
<p>Deliverables are 4 writeups, one per week, of what you’ve found and want to tell everybody, posted to OGM Forum and the OGM mailing list. I’m thinking about 500 to 1000 words, does that sound reasonable?</p>
<p>Please reply below with offers or questions. I’ll choose the correspondent around December 15.</p>
<p>Feel free to forward this personally, but consider that the reporter should be (or become) an OGM member (whatever that means).</p>
<p>Thanks for considering the job! <img src="https://forum.openglobalmind.com/images/emoji/apple/newspaper.png?v=9" title=":newspaper:" class="emoji" alt=":newspaper:"> <img src="https://forum.openglobalmind.com/images/emoji/apple/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> <img src="https://forum.openglobalmind.com/images/emoji/apple/nail_care.png?v=9" title=":nail_care:" class="emoji" alt=":nail_care:"></p>
