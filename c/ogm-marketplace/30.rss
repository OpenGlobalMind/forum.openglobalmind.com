          <title>[EXPIRED] Be a “beat reporter” for OGM Mailing List</title>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Continuing the discussion from <a href="https://forum.openglobalmind.com/t/sold-be-a-beat-reporter-for-ogm-forum/350/18">[sold] Be a "beat reporter" for OGM Forum</a>:</p>
<p>Hi, I’d like to pitch another task following the same basic outlines as Peter’s offer, except instead of summarising the OGM forum, this job is to summarise the <strong>OGM mailing list</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Details (mostly stolen from Peter):</p>
<p>Hi, I hereby offer US$50 (in USD or cryptocurrency) for someone to spend 1-2 hours per week for 4 weeks to browse through the OGM Mailing List, see what’s interesting, what’s going on, what needs more discussion, possible connections between threads, etc.</p>
<p>Deliverables are 4 writeups, one per week, of what you’ve found and want to tell everybody, posted to OGM Forum and the OGM mailing list. I’m thinking about 500 to 1000 words, does that sound reasonable?</p>
<p>Please reply below with offers or questions. I’ll choose the correspondent around December 15.</p>
<p>Feel free to forward this personally, but consider that the reporter should be (or become) an OGM member (whatever that means).</p>
<p>Thanks for considering the job! <img src="https://forum.openglobalmind.com/images/emoji/apple/newspaper.png?v=9" title=":newspaper:" class="emoji" alt=":newspaper:"> <img src="https://forum.openglobalmind.com/images/emoji/apple/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> <img src="https://forum.openglobalmind.com/images/emoji/apple/nail_care.png?v=9" title=":nail_care:" class="emoji" alt=":nail_care:"></p>

          <dc:creator><![CDATA[peterkaminski]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Using the Marketplace</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Welcome! <strong>OGM Marketplace</strong> is a place for OGM members to exchange goods and services, either for pay or for other consideration (including gratitude <img src="https://forum.openglobalmind.com/images/emoji/apple/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">).</p>
<p>The Marketplace is an experiment, starting in November 2020.  We’ll see how it goes.  Please know that we may have to adjust how it works. You’re invited to help!</p>
<p>Basically, though, if there is something you need, <strong>create a new topic</strong> in the <a href="https://forum.openglobalmind.com/c/ogm-marketplace/goods-needed/31">Goods Needed</a> or <a href="https://forum.openglobalmind.com/c/ogm-marketplace/help-needed/33">Help Needed</a> categories.  Or, if you have something to offer, <strong>create a new topic</strong>  in <a href="https://forum.openglobalmind.com/c/ogm-marketplace/goods-offered/32">Goods Offered</a> or <a href="https://forum.openglobalmind.com/c/ogm-marketplace/help-offered/34">Help Offered</a> categories.</p>
<p>Likewise, please feel free to go “shopping” in the any of the Marketplace categories.</p>
<p>When you’ve had an interaction go well, post about your experience in <a href="https://forum.openglobalmind.com/c/ogm-marketplace/reviews-and-ratings/35">Reviews and Ratings</a>.  The more we talk about how the marketplace is working, the better it will be for everyone.</p>
<p>If you had an interaction that wasn’t great, try resolving the problem in good faith first, and see “Problem Resolution” below.  After that, if you feel you must, post about your experience in “Reviews and Ratings.”  Remember that a bad experience with someone else reflects on you, too, not just on them.</p>
<h2>Ground Rules</h2>
<ul>
<li>Be fair. Be nice. Be of good intent.</li>
<li>Obey any and all laws that apply to you and your activities.</li>
<li>If you have a problem or question you can’t handle, ping <a class="mention" href="/u/peterkaminski">@peterkaminski</a> or <a class="mention" href="/u/jerry">@Jerry</a>.</li>
<li>Nobody likes a stale marketplace. It’s expected that posts will be archived to an archive category after about a month.  It will be okay to repost to the live category, but consider what you might need to change or do differently so the request or offer succeeds instead of aging out.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Payments and Deliveries</h2>
<p>Handle payments and delivery of goods/services with the other party.  At this time, OGM doesn’t handle or settle any payments, deliveries, or payment or delivery issues.</p>
<p>It’s hoped that some day we’ll have a <a href="https://forum.openglobalmind.com/t/community-payments-systems/352">community currency</a> to use in the Marketplace, but we don’t yet.</p>
<h2>Problem Resolution</h2>
<p>Work with the other party in good faith <strong>first</strong>.  Ask a friend or someone in the community to help.  If you still need help, ping <a class="mention" href="/u/peterkaminski">@peterkaminski</a> or <a class="mention" href="/u/jerry">@Jerry</a>.</p>
