            <p>Donella Meadows was a great systems thinker.   Her idea of leverage points is that intervening higher level aspects of a system (goals)  has a much bigger impact than does looking at the more detail (feedback loops).</p>
<p>Data Flow Diagrams prod one through goal intervention.   Any other technique do such?</p>

            <p>In order to make sense of complicated events (activities) we first need to understand what is meant by “complexity” .   For activity based systems , complexity means tight coupling between the activities.  That is that there are so many inputs/outputs between the activities that we can not figure out what is going on.</p>
<p>In order to make sense of complex activities, we need to reduce the coupling between activities (events).   This can be done by repartitioning the activities based on following the natural flow which, if done correctly, greatly reduces the inputs/outputs between activities.</p>

<p>“What would you consider to be the best content to learn systems design? (not design systems, but systems thinking)”<br>
“The Systems Thinker is another gold!”<br>
“Thinking in Systems: A Primer by Donella Meadows <a href="https://t.co/NLhEMYspHu">https://t.co/NLhEMYspHu</a> via <span class="mention">@amazonIN</span>”<br>
“<span class="mention">@killerswan</span> Fiction novel writing, biology and medicine history of discovery and errors, history of beginnings of airplanes/ space flight, people’s oriented history of events books, meteorology and weather prediction”<br>
“Reading Philosophy, specially thinkers that analyze structures and systems I.e Hegel, Marx, Deleuze, Foucault”<br>
“I’m working through Ray Ison’s Systems Practice (part of a Masters ) <a href="https://t.co/vBdX8DdoWD">https://t.co/vBdX8DdoWD</a> . Has the concepts that everyone else in the thread has mentioned.”<br>
“I’m listening to Team of Teams - this morning I made a note to read up more deliberately on <span class="hashtag">#systemsthinking</span> - very timely, thank you <img src="https://forum.openglobalmind.com/images/emoji/apple/pray.png?v=9" title=":pray:" class="emoji" alt=":pray:">”<br>
“Donella meadows dancing with systems.”<br>
“End of Average, Todd Rose is a great primer”<br>
“Can’t see a mention of Patricia Shaw in here anywhere &amp; she’s really interesting - takes stuff in a different direction. Also found Werner Ulrich useful when it comes to using systems thinking inside hierarchical organisations.”<br>
“Was Forrester mentioned? <a href="https://t.co/Jkqz4qDmHV">https://t.co/Jkqz4qDmHV</a>”<br>
“Lots of great suggestions! Also really important to consider consequences over time. I really like the futures wheel.\nhttps://t.co/EkOEYq3C7m”<br>
“Any content on category theory”<br>
“Take a look at the explanation of a “paradigm shift” in the novel Ham on Rye … anyone who reads that will always have a greater understanding of systems thinking”<br>
“<a href="https://t.co/31uK7B4sOR">https://t.co/31uK7B4sOR</a> is a gold mine, look for “systems” under mental models.”<br>
“1/2 Idealized Design by Ackoff for this particular question. I highly recommend NOT to start with 5th Discipline as it conflate broader concept of systmes thinking with system dynamics.”<br>
“Not just content but also a great community - <a href="https://t.co/QPyGfqOQVB">https://t.co/QPyGfqOQVB</a> with local chapters, organizing events, wokrshops and providing support to new system thinkers <img src="https://forum.openglobalmind.com/images/emoji/apple/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:">”<br>
“+1 Meadows \nI also find Systems Innovation on YouTube useful: <a href="https://t.co/QZNbtO9QUr%5CnAnd">https://t.co/QZNbtO9QUr\nAnd</a> <span class="mention">@Sys_innovation</span> is  worth a follow”<br>
““System Design” and “Systems Thinking” are not the same thing.  But you can apply Systems Thinking to system design.  I can recommend “Systems Thinkers” (OU) as a good intro.  I would then first read “General System Theory” before diving into the different schools of thought.”<br>
“I was introduced to the subject by Meadows’ “Thinking in Systems” and I loved it.\n\nLater I realized that Factorio (video game) is a great way to represent a system in motion.”<br>
“Biology”<br>
“A lot has been shared here. Also check this and follow the links <a href="https://t.co/WtSvzJEhZy">https://t.co/WtSvzJEhZy</a>”<br>
“Thinking in Systems is the book that got me into system thinking. I have written a couple of Medium articles of this and UX, I’d be interested to find out what people think. <a href="https://t.co/PUb5XBhYbb">https://t.co/PUb5XBhYbb</a>”<br>
“this book defines product innovation as a complex adaptive system and introduces a framework for collaborative system thinking in the product field <img src="https://forum.openglobalmind.com/images/emoji/apple/point_down/2.png?v=9" title=":point_down:t2:" class="emoji" alt=":point_down:t2:">\n\nhttps://t.co/VoKpAlm3eP”<br>

“<span class="mention">@ruthmalan</span> Systems Architecting - Creating &amp; Building Complex Systems by Eberhardt Rechtin, 1991”<br>
“Besides the usual:\n\n- The Systems View of Life (Fritjof Capra)\n- Strategic Modelling and Business Dynamics (John D. W. Morecroft)”<br>
“No Ackoff yet…  Start at minute 1:30; just 10 minutes… \nhttps://t.co/wknz8wpZle”<br>
“<span class="mention">@ruthmalan</span> I’m fairly new to this, but I’ve learned a lot from these books:\n- Thinking in Systems (Meadows)\n- The Fifth Discipline (Senge)\n- Design Unbound (Pendleton-Jullian &amp; Brown)\n- Drift into Failure (Dekker)\n\nAlso highly recommend “How Complex Systems Fail” <a href="https://t.co/rYY25VBHgx">https://t.co/rYY25VBHgx</a>”<br>
“Visual vocabulary of systems: <a href="https://t.co/afzoy08E7N">https://t.co/afzoy08E7N</a>”<br>
“I teach systems for interaction designers at CCA. I use chapters from all these books and my students read all of the Donella Meadows Thinking In Systems. There are tons of resources online from the Systems Thinker and Systems And Us sites. <a href="https://t.co/Xx7f68RQX3">https://t.co/Xx7f68RQX3</a>”<br>
“<span class="mention">@ruthmalan</span> “Dynamics in Action” by Alicia Juarrero is a great book on how minds can be understood as complex adaptive systems. It’s not about design, but it’s full of insight into complex systems. <a href="https://t.co/RnJdEsTHue">https://t.co/RnJdEsTHue</a>”<br>
“Hugh Dubberly’s blog has a lot of good content and links out to plenty of resources. <a href="https://t.co/yz5wH4ti0k">https://t.co/yz5wH4ti0k</a>”<br>
“<span class="mention">@ruthmalan</span> I would also suggest Pegasus Communications books like Study Notes in SD, <span class="mention">@tomfid</span>’s blog, MIT’s course <a href="https://t.co/MJZlh7kMnY">https://t.co/MJZlh7kMnY</a> and  Gene Bellinger’s resources <a href="https://t.co/iCgyOjHdON">https://t.co/iCgyOjHdON</a>”<br>
“<span class="mention">@ruthmalan</span> Please consider the work of <span class="mention">@NoraBateson</span>, <span class="hashtag">#Symmathesy</span>, <span class="hashtag">#WarmData</span>, putting the context back into Systems Thinking.\nIt’s not all boxes and arrows, after all.\nI hope that helps, it took me some years to begin to understand.”<br>
“I approach systems thinking through storytelling. Shows like The Wire (criminal justice system), Borgen (Danish politics system), and The Expanse (fictional future technological/political systems) are some good places to start.”<br>
“+1 on Meadows’s “Systems Thinking” primer. For a more actionable book, see “Growing Wings on the Way” by Rosalind Armson. This PDF is also useful: <a href="https://t.co/c9exyk5QyZ">https://t.co/c9exyk5QyZ</a>”<br>
“<span class="mention">@ruthmalan</span> To date I’ve preferred the older “book” units…as they conveniently integrate with the existing “shelf” systems I already have in place ;)”<br>

          <title>Teaching Systems Thinking Systematically</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Tony]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Systems Thinking</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Existing Systems Thinking books do a good job of presenting SEPERATELY the System Thinking concepts of, for example, Systems Hierarchy, Systems Dynamics, Homeostasis, and Emergence.   But they do not attempt to present how those concepts integrate together. How, for example, do the concepts of Systems Hierarchy and Systems Dynamics interrelate? The answer to this and other integration questions is critical to when working with complex systems.</p>
<p>In contrast, my presentationion   answers such questions. My set of diagrams come together to illustrate the “how to” of many ST projects:</p>
<p>•  Present the high level system goal (Make Candy) and the system’s boundary (Slides 10 and 13)<br>
•  Create the main flow of activities (Slide 13)<br>
• Then incorporate alternative paths (Slide 17)<br>
•  Next, looking at the activities and flows, discover existing feedback loops (Slide 28 and 30)<br>
•  Detail out these initial feedback loops (Side 32)<br>
•  Detail out “to be” feedback loops (Slide 34)<br>
•  Tie into the above steps the concepts that decomposition (of both activities and relationships) is often necessary to handle complexity, and that the feedback loops we can “see” depend upon the level of abstraction we are at.(Slides 37, 38, and 39).</p>

            <p>Per the Meriram Webster dictionary, the first listed definition of a Story is “an account of incidents or events”. Incidents/events are described in terms of who, what, when, where, how and why. This type of a story is told in activity (i.e., event) centric systems thinking models such as Data Flow Diagrams.</p>
<p>The second listed definition in the dictionary is “a fictional narrative shorter than a novel”. This relates to Story Archtypes. We develop such a story to help with walkthroughs of non-event oriented models such as Causal Loop Diagrams.</p>
<p>My take: It may be needed to create a fictional narrative to help a reviewers to engage in the walkthrough of a Causal Loop Diagram, but the underlying system of who, what, when, where, how and why is key to creating the CLD in the first place.</p>

            <p>Many of us are interested in the nexus of issues around soil fertility, regenerative agriculture, climate change, food security and so forth. My collection point is <a href="https://bra.in/9p65Pv">here</a>.</p>
<p>In our Discourse forum, <a class="mention" href="/u/klaus">@Klaus</a> posed a great question that takes a slice out of this issue, which I’ll paraphrase as “How might we drive the social changes needed so we revitalize our soil, as well as the systems it connects to?” (Klaus has a Facebook group around this topic that you can join, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1128113480696630">here</a>.)</p>
<p>Klaus and I are fans of Otto Scharmer’s <a href="http://www.theoryu.com/">Theory U</a>, so we will fold some of that process into the session.</p>
<p>Please join us at 8am Pacific this Friday (August 28), in <a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/j/4154650256?pwd=Zm5DWGRJcmFmZGtBMmI1Wkx2WUQyZz09">this Zoom room</a>.</p>

            <p>I just finished reading <a href="https://www.niskanencenter.org/what-democrats-can-learn-from-the-republicans-about-political-power/">this super interesting article</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Taylor">Jerry Taylor</a> of the (Libertarian) <a href="https://bra.in/7pxJVK">Niskanen Center</a>. Here’s <a href="https://bra.in/4jY7xA">how I curated it in my Brain</a>.</p>
<p>Taylor, a Conservative who swung Left, describes how Lefties don’t understand how to organize to win the future, even though most of the country leans Left. I’m no Libertarian, but I agree with much of his diagnosis.</p>
<p>I’m interested in how this fits our tasks in OGM. I’ve put this under Systems Thinking because it’s about the interplay between policies, politics, power and perceptions.</p>
<p>Part of his advice is not to mirror the tactics of the Right, but rather to understand them and create countervailing institutions and simple narratives. That seems very OGM-y.</p>

            <p>a complex system is a connection of relationships. Looking at individual data points and understanding how they relate to one another will reveal a meme. Here is an example to explain, a position on a particular topic explained to align opinions, in this case to a group of vegetarians and vegans:</p>
<p>===============================</p>
<p>This story truly blows the mind; it turns out that the ‘vegan’ meat imitations are made using soy from China.</p>
<p><em>While America’s biggest beef and pork producers were nearly laid low in April by COVID-19 cases in their workforce, sales of what detractors call “fake meat” boomed. But the pandemic may in time affect sales of plant-based protein, too, as U.S. consumers become more wary of all things China—which supplies a majority of the products’ ingredients.</em></p>
<p>China’s food-processing factories provide most of what goes into vegan burger patties and other meat replacements made by market leaders Beyond Meat and Impossible foods—an arrangement that could damage their standing among consumers in the coronavirus age.</p>
<p><em>Beyond Meat recently signed a significant deal with Shuangta Foods, located in China’s Shandong province. Shuangta will provide 85 percent of the pea protein for its products. The company said its first purchases will total some 285 tons.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.newsweek.com/against-grain-beyond-meat-its-rivals-rely-chinese-ingredients-opening-food-safety-debate-1501585?fbclid=IwAR36Pzc7m0f0A83zqxLpQVXQb-Cj4M9EvISK20axqDEDKqjcLtLO5wbyCmY" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.newsweek.com/against-grain-beyond-meat-its-rivals-rely-chinese-ingredients-opening-food-safety-debate-1501585?fbclid=IwAR36Pzc7m0f0A83zqxLpQVXQb-Cj4M9EvISK20axqDEDKqjcLtLO5wbyCmY</a></p>
<p>At the same time, China agreed to purchase US soybeans, in fact business is booming:</p>

<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture on Friday reported private sales of U.S. soybeans to China of 456,000 tonnes, the biggest singleday soy sale to the world's top buyer since June 11.</p>

<p>So if I get this right, we are outsourcing the supply chain for these attempts to ‘reduce the carbon footprint’ products, thereby giving away the technology to China, because that helps us right now to sell soybeans so the farmers don’t get all upset. In the meantime, Brazil is burning down the Amazon because… business of ‘vegan’ products is just taking off, it will be very bigly. Look at these numbers:</p>

          <title>Helping the System see itself</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Klaus]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Systems Thinking</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>We can broadly state that a system must see and understand itself to function, to avoid sub-optimizations, to calibrate itself based on available resources and constraints.</p>
<p>Patterns emerge when data points are being connected that reveal systemic relationships forming into a picture. One can see such patterns, but how does one communicate them to a broader audience, create compelling story?</p>
<p>I would propose to articulate specific data points that are in relationship, but need to be woven into a story to be understood. Starting with narrative in bullet form, in no particular order to explain the concept, how would one express this so the linkages, the relationships become obvious, the system becomes transparent?</p>
<p>=====================</p>
<p>Agriculture and land use management as practiced today contributes app. 24% of global emissions, but has the capacity to go carbon negative. There is no conceivable way to manage the risks of a changing climate without first addressing our food system.</p>
<p>Currently humanity is using 1.7x the regenerative capacity of the planet to feed 7.8 billion people. The population is on trend to increase towards 8.6 billion by 2030, and to near 10 billion by 2050. Demand for higher value foods (i.e. animal protein) per capita is increasing at the same time. Humanity is depleting the ecological capital of the planet while increasing the demand on its resources.</p>
<p>The toxic byproducts of our conventional farming system are damaging not just the ecosystem as exemplified by the loss of top soil, the pollution and excessive use of fresh water, the air we breathe; it also correlates with an increase in cancer, autoimmune diseases, and antibiotic resistance. Industrial agriculture has depleted the nutrients in our food, contributing to ‘hidden hunger.’ Very little of of U.S. agriculture is focused on fresh, whole foods like fruits, nuts, vegetables, and legumes.</p>
<p>Covid-19 is amplifying the need for change. Consider this:</p>
<p>[According to a CDC report, nearly 90% of patients hospitalized with coronavirus (COVID-19) had one or more underlying health conditions.(<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/2020/04/15/coronavirus-risk-90-patients-had-underlying-conditions/2962721001/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/2020/04/15/coronavirus-risk-90-patients-had-underlying-conditions/2962721001/</a>)</p>
<p>[Coronavirus deaths ‘involved pre-existing condition in 92% of cases in May’ (<a href="https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/uknews/coronavirus-deaths-involved-pre-existing-condition-in-92-of-cases-in-may/ar-BB15C2Oa" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/uknews/coronavirus-deaths-involved-pre-existing-condition-in-92-of-cases-in-may/ar-BB15C2Oa</a>)</p>
<p>Supported by research related to the <a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/2020-advisory-committee-report" rel="nofollow noopener">2020 dietary guidelines</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>More than 70 percent of Americans have overweight or obesity, and the prevalence of severe obesity has increased over the past 2 decades. The increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity at young ages is of particular concern because of their effects on the current health of the child as well as the risks of persistent overweight or obesity into adulthood.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The high rates of overweight and obesity are an important public health problem in and of themselves, and they are a driver for prevalent diet-related chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes, and some types of cancer. At present, 6 in 10 Americans have a chronic condition and 4 in 10 Americans have 2 or more chronic conditions. Various factors contribute to the prevalence of these chronic diseases. Prominent among these are unhealthy dietary patterns and a lack of physical activity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Which lines up with this report by the Rodale Institute: <a href="https://mk0rodaleinstitydwux.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/The-Power-of-the-Plate_-Fact-Sheet_Rodale-Institute.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">Regenerative Organic Agriculture in Improving Human Health</a>.<br>
The Rodale Institute has been a leading voice focused on the need to change our food system.</p>
<p>The Harvard School of Public Health in partnership with the Culinary Institute of America has developed an initiative titled “[Menus of Change]<br>
<a href="https://www.menusofchange.org/principles-resources/downloadable-resources/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.menusofchange.org/principles-resources/downloadable-resources/</a>)”<br>
to support the food service industry in this transition. Now in its eight year, the lack of progress demonstrates the need to engage and educate the general public to participate and demand change.</p>
<p>The industrial food industry has merged into a vertically integrated supply chain, from seed to breed stock to farm to processor to retailer. It relies and depends on the commoditization of food products, long shelve live, easy handling for low skill labor to finalize service delivery. Highly efficient but rigid and unable to overcome structural changes in the supply chain without significant adjustments to their business models.</p>
<p>Regenerative organic agriculture focused on the restoration of soil and the sequestration of carbon must decentralize. Local conditions of soil, access to water, climate, and socioeconomics will require customized types of crops, seeds, rotation cycles.</p>
<p>====================</p>
<p>Where would we go from here?</p>

          <title>Systems Thinking is Alot More Than Feedback Loops</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Tony]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Systems Thinking</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Much of current Systems Thinking literature equates Systems Thinking with feedback loops (i.e., Causal Loop Diagrams and their “cousin” Stock and Flow Diagrams).</p>
<p>But abstraction is also key. Feedback loops vary per level of abstraction.   When looking at a complex organizational system, the feedback loops we see at the 20,000 foot level will be different than those we see at ground level. We therefore need to use a multi level modeling technique (DFDs) . Only then can we model causalities (via CLDs) per level of abstraction</p>
<p>Another  system dynamic outside of feedback loops is state. The behavior of an activity is not only a direct consequence of its inputs, but it also depends on its preceding state.</p>
<p>To model the state of each activity across an organizational system, we need to first look at the bigger picture by modeling integrated input/activity/output via Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs). (Note: DFDs are for modeling any inputs/outputs, not just data.)</p>
<p>There are separate modeling techniques to then model the details of the state of a given activity, such as transition state diagrams.</p>
<p>Another dynamic we typically need to model for organizational systems is non-linear activity. In complex organizational systems, except at the very detail level, there are often relatively few linear activities. Any activity can “kick-off” at any point in time, provided that its prerequisite inputs are present.</p>
<p>Modeling the non-linear activity dynamics of an organization is also a task of DFDs.</p>
<p>The above are just some of Systems Thinking considerations outside of feedback loops.  There are others.</p>
