            <p>I wanted to post one of my favorite rants, from December 2018.  It’s related to US capitalism, finance, real estate, and “farming”.</p>
<p>In the following, “corn,” “maize,” and “soybeans” refer to the industrial varieties which humans don’t eat, but which make up most of what the US grows.  Think industrial feedstocks; not popcorn, corn on the cob, or edamame.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Corn is a platform with both limitless purposes, and one purpose:</p>
<p>to turn rural land into a dependable &amp; infinitely fungible financial asset.</p>
<p>If you want to understand US agriculture, you gotta understand one thing.</p>
<p>It’s not even about making food.</p>
<p>It’s a real estate hustle.</p>
<p>Can I be honest for a second, as an ag person who’s done most of their work in CA &amp; the South?</p>
<p>Land in the Midwest … isn’t really good for much. Sure, the soil’s real nice, but the growing season is too short for most globally-traded cash crops.</p>
<p>Coffee.</p>
<p>Sugar.</p>
<p>Chocolate.</p>
<p>Cotton.</p>
<p>Tobacco.</p>
<p>Rice.</p>
<p>Palm oil.</p>
<p>The Midwest is exactly the kind of giant wet low-population area you’d want for cash crops. Except most of the big-money ones are tropical, &amp; Midwest has a 3-6 month growing season. You’re stuck with annual crops.</p>
<p>“Well what’s wrong w wheat, flax, oats, rye, hemp, &amp; other short-season cash crops?”</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Hemp ain’t been legal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can’t use an entire Midwest’s worth of oats &amp; rye</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wheat &amp; flax grow nearly everywhere, including huge areas of arid US west. Too much competition to rely on.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Enter maize &amp; soybeans. Here’s what they bring to table:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Short-lived enough to make use of Midwest growing season</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Need lots of water- that cuts out competition from the US West</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Humans can’t eat them, but that’s ok, they’re just infinitely fungible starch &amp; protein.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’re just growing raw sources of starch &amp; protein, you can just handle market gluts by inventing a new use. That’s harder to do with crops that make something less malleable like fiber, or (in case of wheat, oats, rye, &amp; most grains) a mid-yield mix of starch &amp; protein.</p>
<p>And boy do we get our market gluts on. Because for 3-6 months every year, the Midwest turns into a giant hot wet basin of plant growing power.</p>
<p>But: without a platform like corn &amp; soybeans, hot wet plains are just hot wet plains. They’re not a financial powerhouse. You couldn’t, say, include farmland as a securitized asset in investment funds.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2016/01/21/getting-your-plot-of-american-farmland-.html">https://www.cnbc.com/2016/01/21/getting-your-plot-of-american-farmland-.html</a></p>
<p>The Food Discourse™ really fixates on how corn is used after it’s grown. “Oh my God! It’s in everything!”</p>
<p>I’m more interested in what that means for those who possess the land to grow it &amp; what <em>that</em> means for our society. And <span class="mention">@SwiftOnSecurity</span> hit the nail on the head.</p>
<p>Part of the Food Discourse ™’s fascination with food manufacturing is that it’s fairly recent. It feels new &amp; foreign. And, you can <em>see</em> the size of the facilities and visualize the money that it takes to build and run them.</p>
<p>It’s a fairly new way to accumulate wealth. It’s visible. And it fits with our “wealth is capital is manufacturing &amp; Wall Street” mentality. So we fixate on it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, most folks have no idea what the value of farmland is. Or that subsidies don’t go to the people growing the corn- they go to the people who <em>own the land it grows on.</em></p>
<p>Most folks have no idea that the big hustle in food isn’t food. It’s real estate.</p>
<p>That doesn’t fit with our image of how wealth works in a capitalist society.</p>
<p>Capitalism is supposed to mean new, modern, and scary! Farmland is ancient and wholesome! Farming is our one connection to more wholesome times!</p>
<p>Bullshit.</p>
<p>Farm landlords were grinding people to death for thousands of years before capitalism was ever invented.</p>
<p>Real estate’s always been the ideal asset. Can be used for food, minerals, or development- and you can collect rents pretty much infinitely w zero work.</p>
<p>But thanks to our focus on “bad stuff in our economy = modern = capitalism = industry” &amp; “agriculture = old = good,” we rarely see farmland as being an asset that can be traded globally.</p>

<p>We’re busy fretting about agribusiness and food processing, meanwhile real live land barons are out here collecting rent &amp; subsidy checks on millions of acres and using it as low-risk ballast for their portfolios.</p>
<p>To be clear: Wall Street is part of this.</p>
<p>So are good ol’ boys.</p>
<p>Most rural counties are run by 2-3 families that quietly own a huge slice of the land. You want to know why rural areas are so fucked up? It ain’t the coastal elites. It’s the landlords right there in the county.</p>
<p>Rural landlords might collect their rent checks directly from their serfs, I mean neighbors in the county instead of a hedge fund office in Manhattan. But they’ve got the same job. Own land, futz around all day, profit.</p>
<p>Ever notice how most proposals to solve farm-related problems- not enough food, too much food, soil conservation, wildlife conservation, water shortages-</p>
<p>all seem to boil down to “throw money at land owners”?</p>
<p>Isn’t that weird?</p>
<p>The philosophy behind conservation payments is sometimes people own farmland that’s too fragile to farm.</p>
<p>But not farming loses money! Therefore, we must pay them not to farm it!</p>
<p>Is anybody asking why own “farmland” that can’t be farmed in the first place?</p>
<p>This is a problem that could be solved a lot of different ways. Trusts, land buybacks, tax writeoffs for donating to conservation, etc. These are all used to some extent.</p>
<p>But the big federal programs are all built around sending landowners a reliable subsidy check every year.</p>
<p>So … yeah. Sometimes rural land ownership is just an instrument for rich people to extort bribes from taxpayers. “Pay me or I’ll ruin your water.”</p>
<p>And sometimes you just monetize it on the corn platform.</p>
<p>Either way, it’s a huge asset class. In many ways it’s more influential &amp; politically powerful than the “industrial food” sector we’ve been taught to fear. But it’s invisible, distant, and quiet, monetizing the earth in ways few of us understand.</p>

            <p>YouTube culture – and thoughtful, well-organized, well-spoken experts – have given us amazing educational resources.  This forum topic will focus on the fundamentals of music theory, which can be – has been – a thorny, difficult subject to approach.</p>
<p>But really, it’s fun!</p>
<p>Here are a couple very good “Music Theory 101” suggestions, each running ~30 minutes.</p>

            <p>As many of you know, I work in and around the Federal government, so I will try to post news and things of interest here.</p>
<p>Probably the most impactful and least understood process is the Budget, I myself am only a novice after 25 years!</p>
<p>While the President’s office makes a budget, it is more advisory and Congress takes it for input. There are different committees in the House and Senate that work on different aspects.</p>
<p>Here is one good resource:<br>
<a href="https://www.usa.gov/budget">Budget of the U.S. Government | USAGov</a></p>
<p>Different parts of the government are funded under different laws and they always have “interesting” names. The Defense budget is the <em>National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for FY2021</em>. Of course the Federal Fiscal Year for 2021 started in Oct 2020, so how is that possible that the government is running without a passed budget? They pass “Continuing Resolutions”. There was one that ran out Dec 11. Then they passed a 7 day which went to Dec 18 (Friday). Then they passed a two day to Sunday and another one day through today.</p>
<p>All the headlines were about the details of the $900 Billion relief package but no one even looks at the $1.4 Trillion budget, totally <strong>$2.3 Trillion</strong>.</p>
<p>It seems OGM could solve health, soil, and social justice with 2.3 Trillion USD!!</p>

            <p><strong>Subject: Cyber Security</strong></p>
<p>FireEye is a well known cyber security firm that got hacked pretty bad. They are the company that usually investigates and helps prevent attacks.</p>
<p>FireEye hack: Cybersecurity firm says nation-state stole attacking tools - CNET <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/fireeye-hack-cybersecurity-firm-says-nation-state-stole-attacking-tools">https://www.cnet.com/news/fireeye-hack-cybersecurity-firm-says-nation-state-stole-attacking-tools</a></p>
<p>Not so long after, FireEye detected another huge cyber attack via a Network Security tools company, SolarWinds. It is the wild west out there!!<br>
This is a highly technical write up of SolarWinds, there are less technical articles out there too<br>

          <category>Knowledge Areas</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I would like to expand my thinking and understanding of viruses and the current pandemic. Please post interesting (your judgement suffices) links to data, articles, journals, studies. Open the aperture wide, but could include:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the role of pollution particles carrying viral material</li>
<li>data on actual deaths in 2017, 18, 19 vs. 2020. The CDC numbers on excess deaths use a “baseline” that is not actually the data from the previous year</li>
<li>to what degree are treatments and mitigations getting better?</li>
<li>which co-morbities are most relevant??</li>
<li>what vitamins and supplements help reduce the likelihood or impact of covid</li>
<li>are their different strands of the virus? Do they have different impacts?</li>
<li>why do some people get so sick and die, and others are mildly sick?</li>
</ul>
<p>I will post some below too to get started,</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>The US Dollar based global financial system has many challenges and its complexity is beyond comprehension. What is the impact of huge expansion of currency by the Fed?</p>
<p>While Bitcoin has some detractors, and is not a perfect system, it is a very different economic system than the US Dollar and will be a major force of change over the next 20 years.</p>
<p>Is anyone here a “Bitcoiner”?</p>
