    <title>Community Marketplace Patterns</title>
    <link>https://forum.openglobalmind.com/t/community-marketplace-patterns/349</link>
    <description>I&#39;m writing down some starter patterns for [[Community Marketplaces]]. I&#39;ve been thinking about these in the context of design and [how to participate in the OGM Marketplace](https://forum.openglobalmind.com/t/how-to-participate-in-the-ogm-marketplace/348); and for a longer time, in the context of [[matchmaking systems]], community currencies, and the [history of retail markets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_retail)).

## Forums

### Goods Needed (Requests)

### Goods Offered (Offers)

### Help Needed (Requests)

### Help Offered (Offers)

### Reviews and Ratings

## Policies Needed

### Ground Rules

What&#39;s allowed, what&#39;s disallowed?

This is a good place to remind people to follow all laws.

### Payments

Allowed, not allowed, which currencies / tokens / barter systems / etc. are recommended, disallowed, etc.

### Problem Resolution

How will problems / disputes be handled? By whom? What recourses are there?

### Reviews / Ratings

How does the community let members know if an exchange was good or bad? How do good or bad actors get surfaced?

Meta: how do you keep reviews and ratings high in signal, and low in socially obligated noise?

### Timebox

Nobody likes a stale marketplace. How long do postings last? Are they archived or deleted? Can they be reposted?</description>
