    <description>OGM is about being as open as possible, and open-sourcing as much as possible. 

That said, it is also a place for people to make a living, so it needs some business models. 

One early example is the notion of StoryThreaders, which we talked about [in this call](https://youtu.be/M2l43ol0so0). Who would like to be a test-pilot StoryThreader? How might we sell a StoryThreading gig?</description>
