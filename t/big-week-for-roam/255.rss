            <p>Agree on polycentric completely. I think the closer to open source we can do that the better.</p>
<p>Obsidian is not open source but it has community spirit. It has a free version forever, no need to even create an account. Roam is $15/month and I think requires a one year sign up (I could be wrong), although they do have a financial assistance program.</p>
<p>The more open the tools the better I think and markdown files are supremely interoperable. Obsidian is coming out with a publish feature soon.</p>
<p>At this point, I need to stretch my writing and publishing muscles, and either would serve me well.</p>
<p>EDIT: I do like the research sponsoring Roam is putting forward!</p>

            <p>I’ve been tweeting to self for decades.<br>
But a point did come when I had to join Twitter as we cannot beat it yet. May not need to as they intend to go decent(ralized)<br>
Eventually everybody will, like NetFlix because it brings 10 fold reduction in operation costs or more.</p>
<p>I am all for Personal First, and decentralization and ownership but we do need a polycentric world.<br>
If Roam becomes open for interoperability and<br>
kind of syndication and global sharing and discovery platform personal and collective will be bridged.<br>
After all we strive to understand to be understood.<br>
Knowledge exists through sharing.</p>
<p>Networked Thought requires Polycentric Networks of People</p>

            <p>I trialed Roam but very much like Obsidian… primarily, I control my own data!!</p>
