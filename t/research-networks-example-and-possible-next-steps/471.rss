    <description>Continuing the discussion from [Roles, redux](https://forum.openglobalmind.com/t/roles-redux/450/6):

I want to mention that part of my $DAYJOB is to coordinate something called the &quot;AI and Data Analysis Network&quot; (at Oxford Brookes University). There are five such [research networks](https://www.brookes.ac.uk/research/) in total:

- Children and Young people;
- Artifical Intelligence and data;
- Healthy Ageing and Care;
- Inclusion, Diversity, and Gender;
- Creative industries research and innovation

It occurred to me recently that the **AIDAN** network addresses an organizational need that other orgs also feel (sometimes in their pocketbook).  E.g., here&#39;s some info from Business Insider:

**Headline**: [There&#39;s a golden opportunity for entrepreneurs to break into the $76.4 billion edtech market](https://www.businessinsider.com/business-opportunities-entrepreneurs-startups-workforce-education-technology-retraining-skills-gap-2020-11?r=US&amp;IR=T) (Paywalled; please [email me](mailto:holtzermann17@gmail.com?subject=BI%20Edtech&amp;body=Hi%20Joe%2C%20I&#39;d%20like%20a%20copy%20of%20the%20interesting%20article%20you%20mentioned. ) if you want a PDF copy.)

Quote:
&gt; A February 2020 McKinsey &amp; Company survey found that 87% of more than 1,000 employers said they&#39;re either experiencing skill gaps in their workforce now or they expect to have them in a few years. ... In 2019, Amazon launched a $700 million initiative to train employees in non-technical roles on technical skills. Companies like PwC, Verizon, and Accenture followed suit with similar proclamations.

I can see how what I&#39;m doing with AIDAN has the chance to offer some significant business value for Brookes — just because they are a university doesn&#39;t make them immune from the need for upskilling!

This leads me to wonder: (1) what do the other networks offer that are of approximately-similar value at the university? and (2) how could *we* develop networks that are also broadly similar to these, but that operate internationally, creating value for many different kinds of organizations and people?

It seems to me that this activity:

**&quot;Document empirically how people are actually filling the &#39;roles&#39; here.&quot;**

...could contribute to such network-building.  The structure I used at Brookes was simply to ask people to register interest in the various networks, listing both *What they can bring to the network*, and *What they would like to get from the network*.  (As such this relates to the idea of an &quot;[OGM Marketplace](https://forum.openglobalmind.com/c/ogm-marketplace/30)&quot;, but now breaks it up into potentially overlapping sectors.)

**tl;dr**: I propose some super-simple OGM-wide network-building activities.</description>
