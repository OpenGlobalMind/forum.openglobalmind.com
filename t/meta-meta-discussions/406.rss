    <description>Hi @peterkaminski

Discourse seems quite nice in one particular way: it is soaking up less of my attention than the mailing list was.  However, I&#39;m a bit surprised that it doesn&#39;t seem to have much built in ability to do &quot;meta-...&quot; discussions.  Yes, we can HAVE them, but that&#39;s not marked inside the system.

Often a thread will get started and someone will come along and take it in a completely different direction.  On Wikipedia this kind of &quot;directorial&quot; intervention would go into a talk page (and if it gets stuck there, it will go into some sort of arbitration, etc.)

It looks like there&#39;s a built in way to do this but maybe people don&#39;t know about it (I didn&#39;t) so I&#39;m going to press save to see if my hypothesis is correct....</description>

            <p>Of course we could also carry on discussing things at any given level of abstraction.</p>

<p>Discourse seems quite nice in one particular way: it is soaking up less of my attention than the mailing list was.  However, I’m a bit surprised that it doesn’t seem to have much built in ability to do “meta-…” discussions.  Yes, we can HAVE them, but that’s not marked inside the system.</p>
