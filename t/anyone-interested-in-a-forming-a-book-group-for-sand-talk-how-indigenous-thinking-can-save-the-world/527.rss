    <title>Anyone interested in a forming a book group for Sand Talk: How Indigenous Thinking Can Save the World?</title>

    <description>I have long been interested in the question of what do we mean when we say someone is “indigenous”? According to *Sand Talk*: 

“An indigenous person is a member of a community retaining memories of life lived sustainably on a land base, as part of that land base. Indigenous Knowledge is any application of those memories as living knowledge to improve present and future circumstances.”

I began reading the book: *Sand Talk* this week and I am really loving it. I&#39;d love to have some folks to talk about the book with. Is anyone out there interested in maybe a weekly or bi-weekly call to share learnings and questions?

LMK!
