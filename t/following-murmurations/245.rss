    <title>Following Murmurations</title>
    <link>https://forum.openglobalmind.com/t/following-murmurations/245</link>
    <description>I&#39;m following [Murmurations – Making Movements Visible](https://murmurations.network/), because it seems like their work might be related to work I&#39;ve seen, and work I want to do.

I wanted to observe that their website (which is fancy and high production value) makes it look like Murmurations is a very simple data &quot;application&quot; -- mapping organizations, even though it says &quot;The Murmurations protocol....&quot;

This thread, [Developing Murmurations V1](https://murmurations.flarum.cloud/d/8-developing-murmurations-v1) - Murmurations Forum, makes it more clear that they are working on a **protocol**, and that the initial &quot;application&quot; was not meant as anything but a prototype that sat on the protocol.

More as it unfolds...</description>

<p>Good thing is that Murmurations properly supports semantics by using JSON-LD, they did a decent job there technically. Don’t know nor necessarily care much about their WordPress plugin or directory, on the other hand, sure, why not pull/push? In their data I think it was mostly coops, so yeah, I don’t have data about coops and wouldn’t currently know what to use such for. In here, OGM struggled way too much with even <a href="https://forum.openglobalmind.com/t/invitation-design-build-a-collection-and-feed-of-project-invitations-requests">a very simple activity/project</a>, so don’t see how Murmurations would be of much use there if there’s no data created nor needed/wanted by pretty much anybody.</p>
<p>Correction: Don’t know if they changed things again since a few months ago, as long as it doesn’t get worse, simply adapting or converting, it hardly needs to be a precise, exact science anyway.</p>

            <p>My gut feeling / concern / something is that they’re following a path of [[Big Design Up Front]], but maybe (hopefully?) I’m wrong.</p>
