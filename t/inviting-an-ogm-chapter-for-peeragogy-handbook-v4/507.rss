    <title>Inviting an OGM chapter for Peeragogy Handbook v4</title>
    <link>https://forum.openglobalmind.com/t/inviting-an-ogm-chapter-for-peeragogy-handbook-v4/507</link>
    <description>Continuing the discussion from [Potential quests](https://forum.openglobalmind.com/t/potential-quests/492/14):

We are starting to get a bit serious about revisions of [PHv3](http://peeragogy.org). One of the questions in play is what contributions for v4 will look like.

An early outline and list of requests is here: https://github.com/PeeragogyLabs/PeeragogyORG/blob/main/peeragogy_handbook_v4.org

It would be nice to have an &quot;OGM chapter&quot;, conceiving of OGM as an early-stage peeragogical community that may have some use for the existing patterns and/or may go its own way (or both).  Perhaps most likely it would fit as a Case Study, without too many restrictions on the form.

Since late 2019 one of the ideas has been to &quot;patternize&quot; the Handbook (i.e., more patterns), so [new OGM patterns](https://forum.openglobalmind.com/t/ogm-workshop-group-1-output/413) could  (also) be included.  Another thing we&#39;re keen to do is to include &quot;mini-Handbooks&quot; — so for example a short guide on how-to-OGM would be interesting to include!  Contributed chapters probably won&#39;t be &quot;due&quot; until half-way into 2021, but draft material can already be workshopped (fortnightly writers workshop meetings to start early next year, details will follow once that&#39;s scheduled). Another way to source some preliminary draft material could be via a guest interview on the Peeragogy in Action podcast!  So, lots of optinons &amp; support available for those who might like to undertake this mission.</description>

            <p>Holtzermann:</p>
<p>Anytime we talk about documenting “what is going on around here”   there is going to be a ton of changes.   And  Diagrams facilitate changes much more so than does text.</p>
<p>If you send me a gmail email address (send to <a href="mailto:ajmarkos2@gmail.com">ajmarkos2@gmail.com</a>)   I can link you up on Google Drive with an example of an activity diagram for a project I am working on.</p>
<p>Pay no attention to the diagram’s subject (biological activities).   The diagramming technique can just as well apply to OGM activities.</p>
<p>Once we are able to share edits, then we can do a couple practice changes.</p>
<p>Tony</p>

<p>Sounds fun and valuable!  I’d be interested and I’m sure other people around OGM would be interested as well. It might be necessary to loop through a discussion with folks a few times to get additions/changes to the diagrams, so if possible please share an editable format as well as images.  I’d say such diagrams would be a good contribution/addition to an “OGM chapter” for PHv4.</p>

I excel at documenting activities.   I use activity diagrams.  Maybe also a little text.<br>
If you would like me to spend some time (time is scarce) documenting how things currently work at OGM, let me know…</p>

            <p>In brief, for a <strong>case study</strong>: write up OGM in a way that explains how things work around here. Try to distill ideas and patterns that others can use. Probably 4000 words is a reasonable length (could be less, or, potentially, more). There may be some editorial back-and-forth but we’re quite open minded about style.  For a <strong>mini-handbook</strong>: write how-to instructions for something super short and simple, maybe 500 words max (think: a recipe from a cookbook; e.g., I found this example “in the wild” today: <a href="https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1343907537675022344.html" rel="nofollow noopener">https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1343907537675022344.html</a>).</p>
<p>If 2 people want to come on the podcast we can do a ½-hour audio version as a warm-up to give a feel of the kinds of questions readers might be most interested in.</p>
<p>Examples of existing case studies are here:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://peeragogy.org/sphinx.html" rel="nofollow noopener">https://peeragogy.org/sphinx.html</a> (3798 words)</li>
<li>
<a href="https://peeragogy.org/swats.html" rel="nofollow noopener">https://peeragogy.org/swats.html</a> (1159 words)</li>
<li>
<a href="https://peeragogy.org/osl.html" rel="nofollow noopener">https://peeragogy.org/osl.html</a> (1324 words)</li>
<li>
<a href="https://peeragogy.org/sole.html" rel="nofollow noopener">https://peeragogy.org/sole.html</a> (2980 words)</li>
<li>
<a href="https://peeragogy.org/collab-ex.html" rel="nofollow noopener">https://peeragogy.org/collab-ex.html</a> (2554 words)</li>
</ul>
<p>But, if you need more space, that’s probably OK!  The other thing to point out is that, unfortunately, <em>all</em> of the existing case studies come from “education” settings, but please don’t assume that Peeragogy is only about education — one of the reasons for inviting an OGM chapter is that we want to show a more representative mix of topics &amp; applications; e.g., this Starter Pack discusses applications in business:</p>

<p>To address the issue of balance, some of these early chapters may be shortened and turned into “side-bars” in the next edition.</p>
<p>The other thing needed is for the author(s) to sign the waiver: <a href="https://peeragogy.org/license.html" rel="nofollow noopener">https://peeragogy.org/license.html</a> so that the text can be distributed without any limitations.</p>
