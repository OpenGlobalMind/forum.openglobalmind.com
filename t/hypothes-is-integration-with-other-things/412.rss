    <title>Hypothes.is integration with other things</title>
    <link>https://forum.openglobalmind.com/t/hypothes-is-integration-with-other-things/412</link>
    <description>Continuing the discussion from [Be a &amp;quot;beat reporter&amp;quot; for OGM Forum](https://forum.openglobalmind.com/t/be-a-beat-reporter-for-ogm-forum/350/14):

I think Hypothesis is really cool, but I wonder how it might be better integrated with other tools? E.g., the &quot;cards&quot; that one produces when annotating something (e.g., [here](https://hyp.is/go?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.arxiv-vanity.com%2Fpapers%2F2001.05046%2F&amp;group=__world__)) could be fed into Miro, or into a visual outlining tool like Scrivener (... though I don&#39;t have a Mac so I don&#39;t use that one!).

*****

Oh, since this is showing up inside the [OGM Marketplace section](https://forum.openglobalmind.com/c/ogm-marketplace/30) of the site — well, at least it does on the front page — maybe it would be interesting to turn this feature request into an explicit &#39;tender&#39;.  Right now it&#39;s too vague, but maybe it&#39;s possible to spec it out a bit further and identify a &quot;Sponsor&quot; who&#39;d want to put some money behind it!</description>

            <p>It’s actually pretty easy to integrate hypothes.is into other services, I’ve done it for my <a href="http://idealoom.org" rel="nofollow noopener">idealoom.org</a>. Not sure about whether miro’s apis allow data entry as easily. Scrivener does not have API’s so one would have to hack the data format. There is a Scrivener for Windows, now, btw.</p>
