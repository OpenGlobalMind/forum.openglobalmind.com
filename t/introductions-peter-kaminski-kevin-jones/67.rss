    <title>Introductions: Peter Kaminski, Kevin Jones</title>
    <link>https://forum.openglobalmind.com/t/introductions-peter-kaminski-kevin-jones/67</link>
    <description>Hello!  I am Peter Kaminski.  Informally, I call myself Pete.

I have a calling to help people of good intent work together to accomplish what they believe to be important. I value knowledge, wisdom, kindness, harmony, wholeness, and gratitude for all living beings. I believe that helping one helps us all, and hurting one hurts us all.

I hope my work on the projects here: helps others work together better; helps others help themselves to accomplish what they believe to be important; creates more knowledge and especially more connections between people; helps heal the world and its beings; furthers my work with personal and collective information spaces; helps me create more artifacts for teaching others about collaboration; and helps me grow my network of friends and colleagues.

Along with personal and collective information spaces, a couple more personal interests that may align: alternative economies; &quot;the matchmaker problem&quot; (as I call it: how might people who have and need things find each other); preparing the world to work together better locally and globally in a changing climate; and intentional communities, and how they sustain and grow and think and remember.

In my professional life, I am a startup entrepreneur and consultant to businesses and nonprofits/NGOs. I do both software product development/deployment, and coaching on collaboration process. I&#39;ve worked on the Internet since 1992, and with computers since 1977.

In my personal life, I am married to the same wonderful woman for 35+ years.  We have two grown kids who were unschooled until university. I enjoy travel, the outdoors, genealogy/family history, photography, music production, and indoor rock climbing.

I&#39;ve lived in the United States, in western Nevada, the San Francisco Bay Area, Southern California, and Washington DC. We currently reside in San Diego.

I have LinkedIn and Facebook profiles, feel free to find me, but I don&#39;t interact much there.

            <p>I am actively engaged with two of the three.<br>
We owned weekly newspapers, business journals, the first web based legislative monitoring service, we defined the space of internet b2b marketplaces back in the dot com and sold at a good time. We created the largest impact investing and social enterprise conference called SOCAP <a href="http://socialcapitalmarkets.net" rel="nofollow noopener">socialcapitalmarkets.net</a> and sold it. The two projects don’t have urls yet but the new work comes under <a href="http://faithfinance.net" rel="nofollow noopener">faithfinance.net</a> reimagining God’s economy.</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="/u/kevindoylejones">@Kevindoylejones</a>, that sounds very forward looking! Could you expand a little bit more on the kind of media and data entrepreurnistic activities, of what nature/kind they were/are? Also, it reads as if you’re not massively busy with them at the moment and focus is on a whole range of cutting-edge domains, or is that an inaccurate impression?</p>

            <p>Introductions. Couldn’t figure out how to make a new one. So I am replying and hope this works. Kevin Jones. I am an eight time successful serial entrepreneur, mostly in media, events, and data. I am pretty good at being early in something that will end up big. I think of it as being on the right block when the people get off the bus to sell my hotdogs.</p>
<p>I am in Swannanoa, North Carolina, living on a farm with grandsons and children on the farm and next door.<br>
I met Jerry a long time ago and used to go to these things called retreats, which were great.<br>
I am working on several projects related to creating an economy of interdependence, including a church based credit union node network with a black church in Allentown PA and a credit union based in the Mississippi Delta. Other projects are similar; providing capital to people who don’t typically get it and definancializing assets through local small business equity funds and neighbors investing in neighbors houses, without interest. I take pictures in the woods and rivers and streams around me.</p>
