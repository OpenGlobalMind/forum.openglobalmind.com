    <title>Daniel Schmachtenberger on sustainable economic systems</title>
    <link>https://forum.openglobalmind.com/t/daniel-schmachtenberger-on-sustainable-economic-systems/644</link>
    <description>Daniel was recently on a podcast with Lex Fridman but the discussion is 4 hours long so even at 2x playback speed it&#39;s a lot to get through. Fortunately, Daniel has written about most of what was discussed: [New Economic Series: Part 4](https://civilizationemerging.com/new-economics-series-4/). I found the article interesting and I think there are some worthwhile ideas in the article related to better decision making systems and tools that can operate over multiple scales.</description>
