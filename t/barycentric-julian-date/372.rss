    <title>Barycentric Julian Date</title>
    <link>https://forum.openglobalmind.com/t/barycentric-julian-date/372</link>
    <description>Today in existential microdread (small imperfect things that might still keep you up at night):

As the Earth moves around the sun every year, it gets up to 8.3 light-minutes closer to, and then up to 8.3 light-minutes farther from, any particular astronomical event.  That&#39;s a 16.6 minute variation over the course of a year!  How can we know when astronomical events really occur?!?

So, rather than relative to the Earth, pick a fixed spot, say the Sun, and calculate the time relative to that spot, right?

But no!  Because of the motion of the planets, the Sun is *not* at the center of the mass of the Solar System, so **it** moves back and forth relative to space, introducing errors of up to 8 seconds.

Real solution: use the Barycentric Julian Date (BJD), which is referenced to the  **Solar System Barycenter (SSB)** , or the center of mass of the Solar System, which doesn&#39;t move relative to space.

::phew::
