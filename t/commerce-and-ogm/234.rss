    <title>Commerce and OGM</title>
    <link>https://forum.openglobalmind.com/t/commerce-and-ogm/234</link>
    <description>I wanted to discuss commerce and OGM a little, following up from my mention of the topic on the Thursday, 2020-09-01 OGM call.

Partly, I just wanted to say out loud that I think we should, sometimes, pay each other real money for goods and services.  There are other commerce+OGM topics, too, would love to discuss those as well.

Also, I want to make this observation right up front: it&#39;s common in our society to want to maximize revenue/profit/etc.  But I&#39;m less interested in that kind of commerce within OGM.

I prefer thinking of internal commerce more as a way to start discussions about value exchange (of many kinds, not just money) and a way for us to do stigmergic signaling, and not necessarily as a primary income (or cost) stream.  So for instance, in an OGM Marketplace, I might offer or accept US$10 for 1 hour of some kind of work, even though in another market that hour might be worth US$100.  (Or blended value, some in $, some in BTC, some in exchange value, some in OGM Bucks, etc., etc.)

I think a good start might be a &quot;Marketplace&quot; category within OGM Forum, with sub-categories like &quot;Help Wanted&quot;, &quot;Help Offered&quot;, &quot;Stuff Wanted&quot;, &quot;Stuff Offered&quot;.

What do *you* think about commerce and OGM?</description>
