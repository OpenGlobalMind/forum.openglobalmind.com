    <title>How to Address the Major Systemic Problems</title>

    <description>In order to make sense of complicated events (activities) we first need to understand what is meant by &quot;complexity&quot; .   For activity based systems , complexity means tight coupling between the activities.  That is that there are so many inputs/outputs between the activities that we can not figure out what is going on.

In order to make sense of complex activities, we need to reduce the coupling between activities (events).   This can be done by repartitioning the activities based on following the natural flow which, if done correctly, greatly reduces the inputs/outputs between activities.</description>
