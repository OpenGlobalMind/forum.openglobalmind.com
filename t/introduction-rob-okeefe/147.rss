**Where on the globe are you?**  I am mainly in Arlington VA and spend a lot of time in Bluffton SC (near Savannah GA and Hilton Head SC)

**What is your main gig?**  I own and run a Management, Strategy, and Design consultancy (Arc Aspicio) mostly focused on the US government, in particular Homeland Security. www.arcaspicio.com

**LinkedIn link?**  https://www.linkedin.com/in/okeeferob/

**What is your connection to OGM?**  I am a long time user of The Brain, on and off over many years. As such I became interested in a variety of Jerry&#39;s initiatives, such as Inside Jerry&#39;s Brain (IJB) chats. Mostly a lurker.

**What part interests you most?**  I am a connector. I would like to see this community evolve and then have connections to spiritual/self development communities and Bitcoin communities and art/photography communities. I have an interest in finding news sources that are close to the place the news is happening and are not part of a major media conglomerate.

**Extra credit: What are your superpowers?** I am a connector and empathetic. I have poor memory, which is why i use The Brain! Ha!

I like finding new music and sources of music. I think the two party system is broken and damaging in the US. I think the USD based monetary system is broken and damaging to the world.</description>
