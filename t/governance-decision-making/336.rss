    <title>Governance &amp; decision-making</title>
    <link>https://forum.openglobalmind.com/t/governance-decision-making/336</link>
    <description>Structureless networks rarely accomplish anything because, typically, they lack processes for making decisions together. Presently, OGM is like such networks, which becomes visible if we think of such questions as: Who can speak for OGM (besides our founder)?  How do we decide whether to create an OGM podcast? Who can invite new members? etc.  

Unless we develop a decision-making process (and exercise it by making a decision, first, about our decision-making process itself), turning our beautiful visions into action and reality will unnecessarily drag out.

Now is not the first time that this issue is coming up. @bhnelson has already addressed it in the **Organization &amp; Governance** section of his [Draft Vision Document](https://forum.openglobalmind.com/t/draft-vision-document/156), three months ago. He suggested:

&gt; OGM is governed based on principles of integration rather than control. Each team/discipline/focus area is expected to govern itself and be a master of a given domain... 

That was followed by this simple diagram:

That model was based on the idea that &quot;we have a collection of initial focus areas.&quot; The specific focus areas (working groups?) will prolly be not predefined but emerging from where the energies of groups of at least 2-3 of us converge.

Last August, it would have been too early to sketch out a process for how proposals can be made, introduced, and voted on. IMHO, it is not too early now. That&#39;s why I&#39;m proposing what follows.

**1. Who can make a proposal and participate in the decision-making process?**

Any member of the OGM mailing list, who shows up in the live Zoom call, where the decision is on the agenda or voice hir questions/comments on a yet-to-create OGM space on [Loomio](https://www.loomio.org/).

**2. Who can decide about what scope of decisions?**

a. If and when we&#39;ll have focus areas or workgroups or guilds, then decisions affecting only those entities will need to be made by their members. 

b. Draft proposals affecting OGM as a whole need to evoke the [advice process](https://reinventingorganizationswiki.com/Decision_Making#The_advice_process), before being introduced for the decision-making via Zoom or Loomio. See this [5-min vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-laa4di8kI) about the latter.

**3. How should decisions about the proposal be made.**

Either by using the [Integrative Decision-Making](https://medium.com/org-hacking/holacracys-integrative-decision-making-process-f750d4b82abc) method or the Loomio way illustrated in the video that I pointed to above, or a combination of them.

I have introduced and facilitated successful decision-making with both processes. I offer to do the same, at least initially, for OGM too if what I described here gains some traction from your sharing your reflections about it.</description>
