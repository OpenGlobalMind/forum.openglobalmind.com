          <p>I have a couple goals with this post:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn more about the diverse ways that others in our OGM community are supporting themselves.</li>
<li>See who might really be struggling, to help tune my radar for opportunities to help.</li>
<li><em>This is NOT intended as a post about ‚Äúhow OGM can make me money‚Äù. It‚Äôs about opening up a space to better understand, empathize, and support each other. Maybe that will involve direct OGM activity, but maybe not.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>On our Zoom calls I catch tidbits about everyone‚Äôs various projects and initiatives. I regularly wonder if OGMers are out in the world getting consulting or per-project fees, or retainers, or have salaried jobs, or hourly freelance rates, or grants, Patreon, blog ad income, book or other product sales, SAAS, retired, or maybe even are just unemployed and suffering.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve only ever had financial success in the corporate grind. I lost a 13-year corporate middle-manager job in summer 2019. It was a job but not an identity, so I had no emotional distress. I was very fortunate to get a severance. After a long and unsuccessful job hunt, I woke up one morning this Spring and asked myself ‚Äúif you thought you would never be offered another corporate job again, what would you do?‚Äù</p>
<p>I have never directly made money with my thinking. It brought me joy, but frankly, always got me in trouble. I would help other company departments facilitate ideation or process improvement. I was helping the company, but not staying in my lane or focusing on my assigned work, so it wasn‚Äôt encouraged. So, I formed small lunch learning groups, or taught useful skills to the children of friends. After decades of this, I had ‚Äúlearned‚Äù two lessons: 1) I will never stop building and sharing useful tools because it‚Äôs who I am, and 2) I won‚Äôt ever actually get paid for it, so I‚Äôd better find an income using my resume skills instead. Hey, not all lessons you learn are correct. <img src="../../images/emoji/apple/slight_smile.png@v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>So, I finally decided to see if I could make a go on my own. It‚Äôs never worked before, but maybe I‚Äôm different now. I‚Äôm doing freelance graphic design and production art. I build art for retail signs, pinball restoration products, and some logos and websites. I‚Äôm now trying to develop some learning products I can maybe sell online.</p>
<p>We cut our expenses way back, but live pretty simply so we don‚Äôt feel like we are giving up anything important. A posture of gratitude goes a long way, because c‚Äômon - in the long and challenging history of humanity, we‚Äôre lucky, and we know it. My ‚Äúdays until broke‚Äù spreadsheet has been awesome. Once a month I divide our Total Cash by our Average Daily Spend for the last 30 days. That gives us a single number - ‚ÄúDays Until Broke‚Äù. As long as it stays the same or nudges up each month, we‚Äôre good. Every check we get adds days to end. It kinda makes a game of it, and why not?</p>
<p>So, if you feel like sharing, how do you support yourself? I‚Äôm sincerely interested in whatever you feel comfortable sharing, with a particular curiosity about the different multi-stream recipes you‚Äôve all found or built. Even more importantly, are you all ok?</p>

          <p>I made, I think, ¬£8000 in the form of a stipend from Enterpreneur First earlier this year, made no money for a while as I was looking for the next thing after that, and about ¬£2400 per month for 3 months in salary at <a href="https://brookes.ac.uk" rel="nofollow noopener">OBU</a>; i.e., around ¬£15K this year; all this post-tax. That‚Äôs not a lot, but it‚Äôs still well above the poverty level (i.e., ¬£288/wk average vs ¬£148/wk for a single person living alone). My job as a Research Fellow doesn‚Äôt pay as much as previous jobs I had as a postdoc (which, themselves, hardly pay market rate for the services rendered, I‚Äôm sure!), but it does allow me much more freedom. Part of my day-job is to seek grants, which is a pretty surefire way to climb the academic ladder ‚Äî i.e., if any are awarded. There‚Äôs clearly an entrepreneurial aspect to that, and at some point it might work well to switch more into entrepreneurship ‚Äúper se‚Äù.   That said, one thing I learned at Entrepreneur First is that VC money isn‚Äôt likely to fund research, no matter how much they may witter on about ‚Äúdeep tech‚Äù and ‚Äúrisk‚Äù!  However, I‚Äôd like to think that I myself have learned (do I need air quotes for this?) a few things about risk in the process.</p>
<p>Given the baseline income I get from OBU, I think the other things that I most need to work on are building the platforms (coalitions, in some cases, more so than teams) for delivering value. I have some excellent colleagues, and some fun/exciting work-in-progress, so I‚Äôd say this is reasonably on track. I also need to work (a lot) on managing my mood &amp; other aspects of mental health, because even though my life is objectively ‚Äúfine‚Äù, a lot of social signals seem to tell me that I‚Äôm doing it wrong, which can be distressing. In some cases this can be resolved with a reframe, e.g., via Nietzsche:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A married philosopher belongs in a comedy, that‚Äôs my principle. And Socrates, the exception, the malicious Socrates, it appears, got married ironically to demonstrate this very principle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or, maybe better, Jung (paraphrased):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Significantly, it is Diotima the Priestess ‚Äî a feminine figure ‚Äî who taught Socrates that there is a ‚Äòdaimon‚Äô by the name of <a href="https://aras.org/concordance/content/eros" rel="nofollow noopener">Eros</a> located between ‚Äòlack‚Äô and ‚Äòplenty‚Äô that can hold two opposites together as a whole. ‚Äî Inna Semetsky, ‚ÄúOne, two, three‚Ä¶ one: The edusemiotic self‚Äù</p>

          <p>I had the same questions. It seems amazing how much time people spend in meetings like this. I‚Äôve had to pull back. In February (before the pandemic was a concern) I quit my job at a genetic testing company as a software engineer to work on some bootstrap non-profit business ideas which so far have not gained traction. I had about a years salary saved up from the sale of the startup I was CTO of and by reducing expenses I have stretched it out to two years at about half my previous salary. In October I started contracting half time as Fractional CTO for a small bootstrapped startup making interactive text books. Right now I‚Äôm focusing on building a contracting business so I can fun other business ideas and experiments then turn down the contracting when something works. I hope this can be sustainable until I retire. My current prices will soon be on <a href="http://BentleyDavis.com" rel="nofollow noopener">BentleyDavis.com</a> but discounts will be available for business that I am passionate about like OGM projects.</p>
