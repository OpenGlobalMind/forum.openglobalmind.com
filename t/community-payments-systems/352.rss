    <description>Checking in on how to do community payments in the year of 2020. (I can&#39;t believe this is still not yet a big successful thing, but whatever.)

## LETS, Time Banks

LETS ([local exchange trading system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_exchange_trading_system)), particularly the open source ones (openLETS, SimpleLETS, WebLETS, LETS Connector), seem to have basically withered and died. (SimpleLETS  *is*  under active dev, but it&#39;s alpha.)

Time banks may be a little less obsolete.

Also see: [LETS Software](https://www.letsf.org.uk/resources/links/lets-software/), Circular Multilateral Barter, [Complementary Currency Software](https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Complementary_Currency_Software), [Timebanking Software Platforms](https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Timebanking_Software_Platforms).

## RipplePay

RipplePay, now RumplePay, has always been interesting, and Ryan Fugger is still running the RumplePay server, although in his announcement of the name change on 2020-08-26, he writes, &quot;So I&#39;ve changed the name to Rumplepay. I hope that feels familiar enough, and also communicates the benign neglect that the site has seen since, oh, about 2008...&quot;

He also notes that [Villages IO](https://villages.io/) is running a Rumple-ish site (although its for a locality).

Separately, this: &quot;[idea: Rumple](https://fiatjaf.alhur.es/rumple.html)&quot;, which is sort of a mashup of RumplePay and Lightning, looks really interesting, but it&#39;s currently just an idea.

## Crypto

Maybe a community altcoin?

After just a short bit of reflection, I think the way to do this is not with an altcoin, but to issue a community-based ERC-20 token. A few initial funders could back the token by buying most or all of the initial minting with fiat.

There are token creation services now:

* [CoinMechanic](https://coinmechanic.io/)
* [TokenMint](https://tokenmint.io/)

Or DYI, [How to Create an ERC20 Token the Simple Way](https://www.toptal.com/ethereum/create-erc20-token-tutorial).

And now there is [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/), a decentralized protocol for automated liquidity provision on Ethereum, in case you want to exchange your tokens for something more liquid.

An ERC-20 token might work well, but would still have the huge disadvantage that users would have to use and maintain a compatible wallet.

Also see: [ERC20 token generator comparison](https://crypt0trad3r46.medium.com/erc20-token-generator-comparison-5d5e2d24ca49), [State of the DApps — Tokenization](https://www.stateofthedapps.com/dapps?tags=tokenization).

## Conclusion

Pickings are still pretty slim. An ERC-20 token would be a lot of fun, but a hassle for anybody who doesn&#39;t want to wrangle a wallet and all the short- and long-term issues associated with it.</description>
