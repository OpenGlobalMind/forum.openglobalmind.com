            <p>Thank you <a class="mention" href="/u/technoshaman">@Technoshaman</a> for your contributions, even with my very limited understanding of interests of the different members, it was obvious that you should be mentioned/notified about the initial post.</p>

<p><strong>What counts as interesting?</strong> Bluntly, I was thinking about any resource someone, in this case, you, can attach the word(mark) to.<br>
<strong>Interesting for whom?</strong> Interesting primarily for you (the individual, who reacted on the initial message). Depending on the level of collective consciousness - that weâ€™re strengthening through our actions, I was thinking about any reading/resource, each of us know!, believe, or at least assume to be interesting for more one member of this forum (otherwise we could share these resources in private as well).<br>
<strong>Interesting in what context?</strong> The broader context would be this OGM forum (while some thread links are cross-posted by <a class="mention" href="/u/peterkaminski">@peterkaminski</a> to the Google group as well), but as discussions evolve, could apply to the various collaborations happening between the members of this forum, that touch the different aspects of CI (as/if they will be covered by a variety of materials curated here). <em>- ok, after reading your answer again, I realised that you wrote pretty much the same thing.</em></p>

            <p>Thank you <a class="mention" href="/u/tovissy">@tovissy</a> for opening this wiki page and the references you added. I imagine that <a class="mention" href="/u/jerry">@Jerry</a> may find some juicy CI goodies in his Brain and so does <a class="mention" href="/u/robert.best">@robert.best</a>, with whom we co-curated the Collective Intelligence &amp;Collective Wisdom community on the now-defunct Google+.</p>
<p>I was wondering what counts for <em>interesting</em> resources. Interesting for whom, in what context? That came from the question of how to select from the 100s CI-related stuff in the research library on my hard disk, which I collected/generated since the mid-'80s?</p>
<p>For now, I added here some of my own writings not necessarily because of their assumed general interest <img src="https://forum.openglobalmind.com/images/emoji/apple/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> but because they reflect where Iâ€™m coming from, which could be useful to know when you guys read about my CI-augmentation project that I offer to federate with OGM.</p>
<p>If it turns out that you, <a class="mention" href="/u/robok">@RobOK</a>, <a class="mention" href="/u/saiiam">@saiiam</a>, and maybe others, are interested in, letâ€™s say, CI applied to innovation in organizations, then we could form a working group focused on that area, which would also give a possible context to what kind of CI content could that group find interesting to curate.</p>
