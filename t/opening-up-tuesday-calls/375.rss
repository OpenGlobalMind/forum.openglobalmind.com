    <title>Opening Up Tuesday Calls</title>
    <link>https://forum.openglobalmind.com/t/opening-up-tuesday-calls/375</link>
    <description>As Matt mentioned in last Thursday’s Open Call, we are broadening the audience of our regular Tuesday check-in calls. Until now Matt, Jerry, and I have been using this time to have more tactical discussions about how to mobilize around the OGM vision. It is time to include other voices in that as well. 

**As of now, the meetings will follow our normal weekly cadence on Tuesdays at 10:00 AM EST/16:00 CEST.**  We can discuss further tomorrow morning. I expect our initial discussions to be focused on the large themes that emerged during the OGM Design call, as well as how to continue harvesting the materials that we’ve received thus far.
