    <title>Visualization of 50 Common Cognitive Biases</title>
    <link>https://forum.openglobalmind.com/t/visualization-of-50-common-cognitive-biases/608</link>
    <description>Very nicely done by The Visual Capitalist!

Idea for an after action review: 

Print these as cards and distributing maybe 5 to 10 to each person on a team (depending on team size) with the instruction to pull out any that they think are present and operating unconsciously in their team. They&#39;d need to back up their assertion with concrete examples and then the rest of the team would reflect on how that bias can be identified early on and compensated for when it shows up, generating agreements on how to work together with less bias in future.
